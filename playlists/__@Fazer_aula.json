With a RAG system in place, vibe coding completely changes.\n\n\nVisit Logs.so: https://logs.so/\n\nLinks: \nRepo: https://github.com/coleam00/Archon\n\n\nAfter seeing the limits of simple prompting, Archon changes how we think about AI coding. By combining context management with a RAG system, it creates a true knowledge hub for coding with AI. You’ll see why many now call this the best AI for coding.\n\nWhether you’re setting up Cursor AI or following a Claude Code tutorial, this workflow shows how an AI IDE coding setup can go beyond shortcuts. In fact, it highlights the best coding AI practices—like task management, real documentation, and memory handling.\n\nIf you’ve ever wondered how to use Claude AI for coding or wanted a Cursor AI tutorial that actually explains the process, this guide breaks it down. I’ll walk you through Cursor AI setup, show you how to use Claude Code in VSCode, and explain where Claude Code vs Cursor really matters.\n\nFrom a software engineering perspective, Archon acts like the best AI agent for coding—tying together artificial intelligence, programming, and engineering workflows into one system. It’s a practical step forward for any software engineer who wants to explore coding with AI in a smarter way.\n\nHashtags: \n#aicoding #cursorAI #claudeCode #AI #ChatGPT #Coding #ArtificialIntelligence #SoftwareEngineering #Programming #Engineering #SoftwareEngineer",

      "description": "Start with the simplest Search - in-memory embeddings with relevance ranking. End with the most complex planet-scale Search - 70+ corpus mix of token, embeddings, and knowledge graphs, all jointly retrieved, custom ranked, joint re-ranked, and then LLM-processed, at 160,000 queries per second in under 200msec.\n\nThis talk will be a fun “one query at a time” survey of all techniques in RAG in incremental complexity, showing the limits of each technique and what the next layered one opens up in terms of capabilities to handle ever-more complex queries in RAG. You’ll learn why queries like [falafel] are notoriously hard to Search over, why chunking your documents can be disastrous, how you can sometimes can get away with a simple bm25, and how some Search problems are so hard to solve that you’re better off punting the problem to the LLM or the UX. Brought to you by the team that worked on 50+ Search products, in the context of Google.com and custom Enterprise Search.\n\nAbout David Karam\nI'm David K. I love straddling the line between deep tech research and application development. I’ve spent a decade at Google as Product Director working on Search’s core AI and NLU systems, helping Search’s own version of “AI Engineers” develop magical applications. Around a year ago I left with my cofounder to start Pi Labs where we’re trying to bring that same spirit to the rest of the industry. Outside work I love to read, cook, and spend time in nature.\n\nRecorded at the AI Engineer World's Fair in San Francisco.

While interpretability has long been an interesting research topic, it is now finding real-world use cases, making it an important tool for AI engineers.\n\nAbout Mark Bissell\nMark Bissell is an applied researcher at Goodfire AI working on real-world applications for mechanistic interpretability. He recently joined Goodfire after 3 years at Palantir, where he worked on various U.S. healthcare initiatives including research projects with the NIH, vaccine distribution during the Covid pandemic (Operation Warp Speed), and AI-enabled hospital operations across many of the nation's leading health systems.\n\nMark is passionate about translating frontier research into practical solutions. He believes that recent AI developments increase the importance broad skillsets, and that roles of the future will blur the lines between traditionally distinct categories such as engineer, researcher, inventor, designer, and entrepreneur.\n\nRecorded at the AI Engineer World's Fair in San Francisco.

You’ll see how mcp supabase n8n setups are structured, and how supabase mcp n8n workflows handle context intelligently.\n\nYou'll also learn how to configure your n8n claude mcp locally or in the cloud, and why the Artifacts feature in ClaudeCode gives mcp in n8n a real edge. We’ll go over adding credentials, using the MCP with Docker, and handling localhost accessibility. This also includes how mcp n8n playwright automations and advanced logic flows are handled within the system.\n\nIf you’re using Cursor, no worries—the mcp client n8n setup works there too with simple config tweaks. This is a full n8n tutorial packed with actionable insights into using ai agents for real n8n automation. If you’re building for clients or scaling an ai automation agency, this setup is battle-tested.\n\nHASHTAGS\n\n#ai #n8n #chatgpt #aiagents #n8ntutorial #mcp #aiagent #aiautomation #n8naiagent #mcpserver #n8nautomation #aiautomationagency #setup #mcpn8n",

      "description": "5 years ago, nobody would have guessed that scaling up LLMs would as successful as they are. This belief, in part, was due to the fact that all known statistical learning theory predicted that massively oversized models should overfit, and hence perform worse than smaller  models. Yet the undeniable fact is that modern LLMs do possess models of the world that allow them to generalize beyond their training data. \n\nWhy do larger models generalize better than smaller models? Why does training a model to predict internet text cause it to develop world models? Come deep dive into the inner working of neural network training to understand why scaling LLMs works so damn well.\n\nWant to see more videos like this in the future?
