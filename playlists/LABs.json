      "description": "Large Language Models (LLM's) are starting to revolutionize how users can search for, interact with, and generate new content. Some recent stacks and toolkits around Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) have emerged where users are building applications such as chatbots using LLMs on their own private data. This opens the door to a vast array of applications. However while setting up a naive RAG stack is easy, productionizing it is hard. In this talk, we talk about core techniques for evaluating and improving your retrieval systems for better performing RAG.\n\nRecorded live in San Francisco at the AI Engineer Summit 2023. See the full schedule of talks at https://ai.engineer/summit/schedule & join us at the AI Engineer World's Fair in 2024! Get your tickets today at https://ai.engineer/worlds-fair\n\nAbout Jerry Liu\nJerry Liu, the co-founder and CEO of LlamaIndex, brings a wealth of expertise to his role, with a career that spans the realms of ML engineering, AI research, and startups. Prior to his current position, he served as an ML engineer at Quora and engaged in AI research with Uber's ATG. A Princeton alumnus, Jerry's professional journey has been enriched by various publications, including his most recent works: Deep Structured Reactive Planning and MuSCLE: Multi Sweep Compression of LiDAR using Deep Entropy Models, reflecting his commitment to the field.",

Ele segue a identidade visual da marca e ainda permite editar imagens com o comando /edit.\n\nEssa é a solução ideal pra quem tem um fluxo constante de criação — agências, criadores de conteúdo, e até empresas que querem manter consistência visual sem depender de designers o tempo todo.\n\nE o mais legal: tudo isso foi feito no N8N, e o passo a passo completo estará disponível na Trilha Automatizando Tudo com N8N, da Asimov Academy em breve.",

Regulation D (or Reg D) contains the rules providing exemptions from the registration requirements, allowing some companies to offer and sell their securities without having to register the securities with the SEC. A Regulation D offering is intended to make access to the capital markets possible for small companies that could not otherwise bear the costs of a normal SEC registration. Reg D may also refer to an investment strategy, mostly associated with hedge funds, based upon the same regulation. The regulation is found under Title 17 of the Code of Federal Regulations, part 230, Sections 501 through 508. The legal citation is 17 C.F.R. §230.501 et seq.\nOn July 10th, 2013, the SEC issued new final regulations allowing public advertising and solicitation of Regulation D offers to accredited investors. \n\n\nThis video is targeted to blind users.\n\nAttribution:\nArticle text available under CC-BY-SA\nCreative Commons image source in video",

Every time your model output changes, hardcoded components break. When you add new use cases, you're rewriting code. Most developers default to text-based interfaces because they're easy, but they create a poor user experience.\nThesys C1 solves this by acting as middleware between your AI model and frontend. It automatically converts raw model responses into interactive UI components in real-time, adapting to your specific use case while matching your design system.\n\nWHAT YOU'LL LEARN\nThe fundamental UI problem in AI app development How C1 works as a Generative UI API Complete integration walkthrough for existing apps Live demo with Vercel AI SDK Interactive components, dashboards, and dynamic forms Tool calling and structured data rendering Claude skill setup for C1 development\n\nThis is how AI applications will work in the future.

This means the AI can query for specific tasks without flooding its context window, allowing it to maintain focus and \"remember\" the entire plan.\n\nI put it to the test on a real-world project: migrating my 500+ article Astro blog from MDX files to Astro DB.

      "description": "✅ Experimente o Sora 2 gratuitamente no insMind:\nhttps://www.insmind.com/utms/d13f82b9777e41eab436055f4cf3b60a\n\n✅ CURSO FILMMAKER COM IA: https://manualdeia.com.br/r/cursovideo/SdO7qwI2CiA \nAprenda as melhores técnicas para criar vídeos com Inteligência Artificial.\n🔽 O QUE VOCÊ GANHA NO CURSO 🔽\n⭐ Acesso ao GERADOR DE PROMPTS;\n⭐ Acesso ao BIBLIOTECA DE PROMPTS;\n⭐ Acesso ao FÓRUM EXCLUSIVO;\n⭐ Acesso a DESCONTOS EXCLUSIVOS nos Parceiros;\ne muitos ...\n\n👉 Post com todos os Prompts:\nhttps://www.manualdeia.com.br/prompts-virais-para-sora-2/\n\nPrompts Virais para Sora 2: o novo ouro da criação de vídeos com IA\n\nA chegada do Sora 2 transformou a forma como os criadores pensam em vídeo. A ferramenta da OpenAI elevou o nível do realismo, da fluidez e da narrativa visual gerada por inteligência artificial. Mas o verdadeiro segredo do sucesso dentro dessa nova era está nos prompts virais — aquelas combinações de palavras e conceitos que fazem um vídeo se espalhar pela internet, como se tivesse vida própria.\n\nTudo começa com a estrutura. Um prompt viral para Sora 2 não é apenas uma descrição técnica. É uma mini-história que equilibra clareza e emoção. Termos como “cinematic lighting”, “realistic motion” e “8K depth” ainda são fundamentais, mas o que realmente atrai atenção é a ideia por trás. Um exemplo é o uso de contrastes inesperados: um robô tocando piano em um campo de flores, uma criança olhando o nascer do sol em Marte, ou uma tempestade se formando dentro de um copo d’água. Essas imagens carregam um elemento de surpresa que desperta curiosidade e engajamento.\n\nOutra característica dos prompts virais em Sora 2 é o domínio da atmosfera. Não basta descrever o que acontece — é preciso transmitir o que se sente. Palavras que evocam sensações, como “melancholic tone”, “epic scale”, “mystical glow” ou “intimate realism”, ajudam o modelo a criar cenas com peso emocional. Os vídeos mais compartilhados são aqueles que parecem ter alma, mesmo quando são inteiramente digitais.\n\nTambém há uma ciência por trás do algoritmo social. Prompts que se tornam virais geralmente têm temas que tocam o imaginário coletivo: o futuro da humanidade, a nostalgia de um mundo perdido, a beleza da natureza, ou a mistura entre tecnologia e emoção. Criadores que dominam essa linguagem usam o Sora 2 não só para mostrar poder técnico, mas para provocar reflexão. É arte e engenharia em uma mesma linha de texto.\n\nO formato curto também contribui para o viral. Prompts projetados para vídeos de 5 a 10 segundos tendem a ter maior retenção em plataformas como YouTube Shorts, TikTok e Instagram Reels. Um início impactante, uma transição fluida e um desfecho visual inesperado são a receita clássica para despertar a reação imediata do espectador — aquela pausa involuntária antes de compartilhar o vídeo.\n\nPor fim, os prompts virais para Sora 2 são como fórmulas alquímicas: não existe uma regra fixa, mas há princípios universais. Clareza, emoção, contraste e timing. Quando esses elementos se alinham, o resultado é um vídeo que parece transcender o código — um fragmento de imaginação digital que ganha vida própria.\n\nO Sora 2 não é apenas uma ferramenta de geração de vídeo. É um espelho do imaginário humano. E os prompts virais são a linguagem secreta que conecta criadores e público nessa nova fronteira entre o real e o imaginado.\n\n#viralvideo #canaldarkyoutube #sora2 #openai #insmind #manualdeia",

      "description": "📌  Compre este Workflow aqui:\nhttps://alvoleads.com.br/templates-n8n/barbearia/\n\n📱  Grupo Whatsapp: https://alvoleads.com.br/grupo\n\n📌 Curso de Prompt: https://alvoleads.com.br/prompts\n\n📂 Templates N8N: https://alvoleads.com.br/templates-n8n/\n📱 API de Whatsapp que uso: https://alvoleads.com.br/y-uzapi\n\n➡️ Minha mentoria: https://alvoleads.com.br/y-mentoria-ia\n➡️ Meu Whatsapp: https://hermesmind.com.br/yt-afonso\n\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\n\nJá imaginou ter um Agente de IA para Barbearia que atende seus clientes no WhatsApp de forma automática, responde com naturalidade e ainda faz agendamentos automáticos direto no Google Calendar?\n\nÉ exatamente isso que eu mostro neste vídeo. Você vai aprender passo a passo como criar Agentes de IA no WhatsApp usando o N8N, conectando todas as ferramentas de forma inteligente e prática.\n\nA maioria das barbearias ainda depende de atendentes humanos para responder mensagens e marcar horários, o que gera filas de espera e perda de clientes. Com um Agente de IA para WhatsApp, você automatiza tudo isso sem perder o toque humano.\n\nO agente conversa com o cliente, entende o que ele quer, apresenta os serviços disponíveis, informa valores e envia os horários disponíveis — tudo em segundos.\n\nNesse vídeo eu mostro como montei o fluxo completo dentro do N8N, unindo IA, Google Calendar e WhatsApp.\n\nO resultado é um Agente de IA para Barbearia que faz o atendimento do início ao fim, confirmando o agendamento com mensagens personalizadas e até enviando lembretes automáticos.\n\nÉ o tipo de automação que transforma o atendimento tradicional em algo realmente profissional e escalável.\n\nDurante o vídeo, eu também explico a importância de estruturar bem o prompt — o cérebro da IA. Ele define a linguagem, o tom de voz e as instruções que o agente deve seguir.\n\nUm Agente de IA no N8N só funciona de verdade quando o prompt é claro, dividido por blocos e otimizado para respostas curtas, diretas e humanizadas. Assim, o cliente sente que está falando com alguém real, e não com um robô.\n\nAlém disso, o fluxo que eu ensino pode ser adaptado para qualquer outro negócio: clínicas, estúdios de beleza, academias e até profissionais autônomos.\n\nO segredo é entender como criar Agentes de IA no WhatsApp de forma estratégica, com lógica de atendimento e integração com sistemas de agenda como o Google Calendar.\n\nOutro ponto que abordo é o uso de IA para interpretar áudios. Cada vez mais clientes mandam mensagens de voz pedindo horários, e o Agente de IA que entende áudio é capaz de captar o que foi dito e agir de acordo — confirmando o corte, reagendando um horário ou oferecendo um serviço adicional. Esse tipo de recurso eleva a experiência do cliente e torna o processo ainda mais natural.\n\nO Agente de IA de atendimento que ensino no vídeo também pode lidar com cancelamentos, reagendamentos e confirmações. Ele é totalmente personalizável: você define o nome do barbeiro, os horários disponíveis, o tempo de cada serviço e a forma de resposta.\n\nAssim, cada barbearia pode ter um agente único, com a identidade da marca e o estilo de comunicação que quiser.\n\nO grande diferencial dessa automação é a integração total com o Google Calendar, que garante que todos os agendamentos automáticos fiquem sincronizados e atualizados em tempo real. Isso evita conflitos de horário e garante que o barbeiro tenha sempre o controle total da agenda, mesmo sem precisar abrir o celular.\n\nAo longo do vídeo, eu também mostro exemplos de mensagens, estrutura de prompts e dicas práticas pra deixar o fluxo leve, rápido e escalável. Essa é a base de qualquer Agente de IA no N8N: uma lógica simples, conectada e que realmente entrega resultado.\n\nSe você quer levar sua barbearia para o próximo nível, economizar tempo e oferecer uma experiência moderna pros seus clientes, esse vídeo é pra você.\n\nAprenda como criar Agentes de IA no WhatsApp do jeito certo, com foco em atendimento humanizado, agendamento automático e integração com Google Calendar.",

Se antes o uso da IA era visto apenas como uma ferramenta para criar pequenos clipes experimentais ou recursos visuais complementares, agora essa tecnologia já é capaz de sustentar narrativas completas, com começo, meio e fim. Essa mudança vem transformando tanto a forma de criar conteúdo quanto a maneira como produtores, criadores e empresas enxergam o futuro da produção audiovisual.\n\nA principal característica da produção de vídeos longos com IA é a capacidade de automatizar etapas que antes exigiam equipes inteiras: roteiro, direção de arte, animação, edição, correção de cor, efeitos visuais e até trilha sonora. Ferramentas avançadas permitem gerar cenas completas a partir de descrições de texto, criando movimentos de câmera, cenários detalhados e personagens coerentes. Claro, ainda existem limitações, principalmente na consistência ao longo de uma narrativa extensa, mas a evolução tem sido constante e rápida.\n\nOutra grande mudança está no processo criativo. Em vez de começar com um storyboard desenhado, muitos criadores iniciam a partir de prompts: instruções textuais que descrevem ambiente, atmosfera, cenas e estilo visual. O refinamento vem por iteração, onde o criador ajusta o prompt e reprocessa a cena até encontrar o resultado desejado. Isso transforma a função do criador em algo muito próximo ao papel de um diretor que guia a inteligência artificial para alcançar a estética e o tom pretendidos.\n\nA economia de recursos também é um dos fatores que fazem a produção de vídeos longos com IA se destacar. Mesmo com ferramentas pagas, o custo é muito menor do que o de uma produção tradicional. Não há gastos com locações, equipamentos, atores, figurinos e equipes numerosas. Para pequenas produtoras, criadores independentes e até empresas que querem gerar conteúdo educativo ou de marketing em larga escala, essa redução de custo abre portas que antes eram inacessíveis.\n\nPorém, a produção de vídeos longos não é apenas um processo automatizado. Criar algo que prenda atenção por vários minutos ou até horas exige domínio narrativo. A IA pode gerar imagens e cenas, mas quem dá sentido à história é o ser humano. A capacidade de construir personagens, provocar emoção e transmitir mensagem ainda é um talento que depende de sensibilidade, intenção e experiência criativa. A tecnologia auxilia, mas não substitui o olhar humano.\n\nO cenário aponta para um futuro onde o criador terá mais poder e autonomia. O que antes era um processo caro, lento e restrito a grandes estúdios está se tornando acessível a qualquer pessoa com uma ideia e vontade de aprender a dialogar com as ferramentas de IA. Essa democratização pode resultar em uma explosão de novos estilos de narrativa, novos gêneros audiovisuais e novas formas de expressão visual.\n\nA produção de vídeos longos com inteligência artificial é mais do que uma tendência tecnológica: é um novo capítulo para o cinema, para o conteúdo digital e para a arte visual. A fronteira entre imaginação e execução está se tornando cada vez menor. E quem souber explorar essa fronteira com criatividade estará na vanguarda do próximo grande movimento cultural da era digital.\n\n#iavideo #veo3 #googleveo3 #nanobanana2 #manualdeia",

      "description": "Visit Traycer: https://traycer.ai/\n\nIn this video, I'll be showing you Traycer's massive new update called \"YOLO Mode\" which completely changes how you interact with AI coding tools. I will guide you through setting up fully autonomous loops using Custom CLI Agents and Claude Code, allowing you to step away while the AI plans, codes, verifies, and fixes bugs all on its own.\n\n--\nKey Takeaways:\n\n🚀 Traycer’s new YOLO Mode creates a fully autonomous loop for planning, coding, verifying, and fixing without manual input.  \n🛑 The update solves the \"babysitting\" problem, eliminating the need to click \"Execute\" or \"Verify\" after every single step.  \n⚙️ Custom CLI Agents allow you to wrap tools like Claude Code with specific flags like `--dangerously-skip-permissions` for true automation.  \n📂 You can set agents to \"Workspace Scope\" to share configurations via GitHub, solving \"works on my machine\" issues for teams.  \n✅ Granular Verification Handoff settings let you define strict exit criteria based on Critical, Major, or Minor issues.  \n🏗️ The workflow shifts your role from an \"operator\" clicking buttons to an \"architect\" defining phases and quality standards.  \n💡 Essential pro-tips included: Prevent your computer from sleeping during loops and monitor your Artifact Slot usage.",

      "description": "Gemini 3.0 Pro Is Unreal: Modern Websites, HTML Canvas & 3D Graphics From One Prompt!\n\nCode A Program....\n\nGemini 3 Pro just changed the game. 🚀\nIn this video, I push Gemini 3 Canvas to its limits — full landing pages 🌐, interactive tools 🧩, 3D effects 🌀, React apps ⚛️, Three.js scenes 🎮, and even HTML Canvas animations ⚡… all from simple prompts.\n\n🔗 Official Gemini Links:\nGemini Website: https://gemini.google.com\nGemini 3 Announcement: https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-3/\n\nI tested everything:\n⚡ Cyberpunk voltage landing page with glitch effects\n🧩 Interactive SaaS tool (“RegexGod”)\n🌀 3D Canvas-based “Volt” webpage\n⚛️ Fully coded React.js SaaS landing page\n🔴 Perfectly rendered 3D Pokémon ball in Three.js\n\nPrompts I Used:\n\n1. VOLTAGE Web\nThe aesthetic should be 'Cyberpunk High-Voltage.' Think neon yellows and blacks, glitch effects, and raw energy. It should feel aggressive but premium.\n----------------------------------------\n2. Regex Web:\nThe \"Interactive SaaS\" Test\nTarget: Testing Logic, DOM manipulation, and Micro-interactions.Why it’s hard: It requires the AI to build a \"mini-app\" inside the landing page, not just static text.\nAct as a Senior Frontend Engineer. Build a landing page for a developer tool called 'RegexGod: AI for Regular Expressions.\nThe Hero Section (The Hook):\nInstead of a static image, the hero section must be a functional playground.\nInput field A: 'Enter text here.'\nInput field B: 'Enter Regex pattern.'\nResult: Real-time highlighting of the text that matches the pattern.\nNote: You must write the JS logic to make this actually work in the browser.\nThe Design System:\nUse a 'Dark Mode IDE' aesthetic. Monospace fonts, syntax highlighting colors (Dracula theme), and a minimalist UI.\nDeep Think (Reasoning):\nBefore coding, explain how you will handle the real-time validation efficiently to avoid crashing the browser on long strings.\n-------------------------------------------------\n3. Canvas central cylinder\nCreate a single-file HTML solution.\nBackground: Use the HTML5 Canvas API to create a background of crackling lightning bolts that randomly strike the screen.\nScroll Interaction: As I scroll down, the product can (a central cylinder) should rotate 360 degrees (use CSS 3D transforms) and 'explode' into its ingredients.\nTypography: Use massive, stretched kinetic typography that moves horizontally as the user scrolls vertically.\nEvery project was generated in one shot using Gemini 3 Canvas — no rewriting, no extra prompting. This model is already outperforming GPT-5.1 and Claude 4.5 in key reasoning, coding, and multimodal tasks, and the results speak for themselves.\n--------------------------------------------------\n4. SaaS \ncreate a AI SaaS landing page for budget tracker\n--------------------------------------------------\n5. 3D Pokeman ball\ncreate a 3D Pokeman ball using three js\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you’re a developer, designer, or AI builder, this is the clearest look at what Gemini 3 can actually do in real workflows: website generation, UI design, animations, 3D visuals, and production-level code.\n\n🎯 What you’ll learn:\nHow Gemini 3 Canvas builds complete HTML/CSS/JS websites\nHow to test landing-page prompts effectively\nHow to generate full SaaS UIs & tools with one prompt\nHow Canvas handles animations, parallax, and 3D effects\nHow Gemini 3 compares to GPT-5.1 and Claude 4.5 in practice\n\n🔥 If you want more deep-dives, breakdowns, and real developer tests, make sure to subscribe.

      "description": "In this video, Claude finally shows how to fix basic AI-designed UIs using powerful Claude Skills inside Claude Code. I also test Claude AI in real projects, using Claude Code VSCode setups to see how creative it can actually get.\n\n🔗 Resources Mentioned\n\nImproving Front-End Design Through Skills\nhttps://www.claude.com/blog/improving-frontend-design-through-skills\n\nClaude Skills Explained\nhttps://www.claude.com/blog/skills-explained\n\nWeb Artifacts Builder Skill (GitHub)\nhttps://github.com/anthropics/skills/blob/main/web-artifacts-builder/SKILL.md\n\nIn this video, we take a deep dive into how Claude approaches front-end design and why so many AI-generated UIs still look basic. Using Claude Skills, Claude Code, and the new design-focused features from Claude AI, I break down how you can push your AI to create genuinely aesthetic layouts instead of the usual safe, generic outputs.\n\nWe explore real examples, test Skills inside actual projects, and compare how these instructions reshape everything—from typography to themes, gradients, and component structure. If you're into AI coding, vibe coding, or building full projects with an AI partner, this video shows how far you can push design quality with the right system prompts.\n\nYou'll also see how Claude behaves inside Claude Code VSCode, what works, what breaks, and how the MCP ecosystem ties into all of this. I also compare Claude vs ChatGPT and explain how tools like Claude Code MCP and Claude MCP help load specialized expertise exactly when the model needs it.\n\nWhether you’re experimenting with AI tools, exploring new artificial intelligence workflows, or just want to learn how to use Claude for front-end design, this breakdown shows how the new Claude 4 models actually perform when put to the test.",
