      "description": "Gemini 3 is here, and it is evolving the way developers build. In this episode of The Agent Factory, host Amit Maraj sits down with Paige Bailey from Google DeepMind to break down the latest rapid fire releases from Google, including the highly anticipated Gemini 3 Pro, Nano Banana Pro, and the new AI-native IDE, Antigravity.\n\nGemini 3 represents a massive leap forward, moving from multimodal understanding (Gemini 1) and reasoning (Gemini 2) to genuine agency and acting. It excels at coding, tool use, and long range planning—as evidenced by its strong performance on a variety of agentic benchmarks.\n\nListen along as Paige builds \"Nordic Shield\"—a multimodal insurance cataloging agent—live in Google AI Studio using the new build feature and Gemini Live. As a bonus, Amit demonstrates how to use the Antigravity IDE to redesign a website using nothing but screenshots and Gemini 3’s multimodal capabilities.\n\nChapters:\n00:00 - Intro & welcome Paige Bailey \n00:42 - Google's new AI releases \n02:49 - What is Gemini 3?
