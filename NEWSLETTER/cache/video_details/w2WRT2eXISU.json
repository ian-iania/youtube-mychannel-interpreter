      "description": "What happens when you migrate 150,000 repositories from a tangled web of legacy CI/CD tools to GitHub? CVS Health found out — and lived to tell the tale. They reshaped their entire developer experience by consolidating disparate tools into GitHub and GitHub Actions, freeing their platform teams to build instead of maintaining outdated systems. The result? Thousands of developers now share a modern workflow that makes collaboration faster, easier, and more consistent across one of healthcare's largest tech organizations.
