In this video, you’ll learn how to build an AI Agent with Gemini 3 Pro and the Agent Development Kit (ADK). You’ll explore how to build a single agent with access to Google Search as its tool, and interact with it using a web UI. We will also learn how Gemini 3 Pro uses Thought Signatures and we will explore its chain of thought when the agent receives a prompt. \n\n\nResources:\nGetting started with uv →  https://goo.gle/4a7M7KG \nADK Google Search Tool docs → https://goo.gle/3LGFKUR \nGithub Repo for the AI Agent built with Gemini 3 Pro → \nhttps://goo.gle/4pq0pep \n\nTimestamps:\n0:00 - Introduction to Gemini 3 Pro\n0:32 - Initializing the Project & Installing ADK and GenAI libraries \n1:25 - Setting up Google AI Studio’s API Key & Creating Agent Scaffolding with ADK Create\n2:00 - Implementing the Google Search Tool \n2:33 - Configuring the Gemini 3 Pro Model \n3:14 - Deploying the Agent to ADK Web \n4:29 - Testing the Agent\n5:24 - Thought Signatures and Analyzing Chain of Thought\n6:40 - Conclusion\n\nSpeaker: Smitha Kolan \nProducts Mentioned: Gemini, Google AI, Agent Development Kit (ADK)",
