Naive RAG\n\n- Direct retrieval with no sophisticated filtering or feedback\n- Example: Customer support chatbots answering FAQs from documentation\n\n2\\. Agentic RAG\n\n- Autonomous planning, tool use, and dynamic retrieval strategies\n- Example: Competitive intelligence analysts who autonomously monitor and analyze competitor data\n\n3\\. HyDE (Hypothetical Document Embeddings)\n\n- Generates \"hypothetical\" documents for better retrieval matching\n- Example: Adaptive Technical search where users describe problems differently than usual\n\n4\\. Graph RAG\n\n- Structures data as knowledge graphs for richer contextual reasoning\n- Example: Medical support systems generating hypothetical patient cases based on symptom relationships\n\n5\\. Corrective RAG\n\n- Iterative self-correction to improve retrieval accuracy\n- Example: Financial report analysis that self-corrects when retrieving across multiple data sources\n\n6\\. Contextual RAG\n\n- Adapts retrieval by interpreting broader conversational context\n- Example: Meeting assistants understanding strategic discussions across multiple sessions\n\n7\\. Modular RAG\n\n- Composable, plug-and-play modules for custom workflows\n- Example: Custom workflows combining multiple retrieval processes and specialized tools\n\n8\\. Hybrid RAG\n\n- Mixes semantic search and embedding-based retrieval\n- Example: Legal research combining exact statutory citations with semantic principle matching\n\n📌 Quick Selection Guide:\n\n- Naive RAG → Simple knowledge base Q&A\n- Agentic RAG → Complex autonomous workflows with tool integration\n- HyDE → Query-document vocabulary mismatch scenarios\n- Graph RAG → Interconnected data requiring relationship reasoning\n- Corrective RAG → High-accuracy requirements with verification needs\n- Contextual RAG → Multi-turn conversations needing memory\n- Modular RAG → Custom enterprise pipelines with multiple retrieval steps\n- Hybrid RAG → Mixed semantic understanding and exact retrieval",
