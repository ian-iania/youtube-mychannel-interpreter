This approach leverages Claude Code's capabilities to transform MCPs into efficient backend APIs. Discover how Claude Skills combined with MCP as code enables progressive disclosure, smarter workflows, and better state management for AI development.\n\nIn this video, I break down Anthropic's paper on solving MCP context window problems. You'll learn why traditional MCPs consume 10%+ of your context before you even start working, and how converting them to code fixes this issue. I cover progressive disclosure for loading only what you need, context-efficient tool results that prevent data bloat, powerful control flow that reduces hallucinations, privacy-preserving operations for sensitive data, and state persistence using Claude's filesystem-based approach.\n\nWhether you're building with Claude or just curious about optimizing AI workflows, this video shows you practical solutions that software engineers have used for years—now applied to AI agents. Perfect for developers working with Model Context Protocol and anyone looking to maximize their AI agent's efficiency.\n\n#ClaudeAI #MCP #AIAgents #ClaudeCode #ModelContextProtocol #AICoding #Anthropic #ClaudeSkills #AIWorkflow #SoftwareDevelopment #AITools #MachineLearning #CodingWithAI #AIAutomation #DeveloperTools",
