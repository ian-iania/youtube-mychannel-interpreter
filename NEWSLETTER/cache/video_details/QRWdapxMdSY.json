      "title": "AI Copilots for Tech Architecture: The Highest-ROI Use Case You’re Not Building — Boris B., Catio",
      "description": "AI copilots have already changed the game in software development. But the most strategic, highest-leverage use case is still overlooked: tech architecture decision-making. Architecture decisions drive hundreds of millions in technology spend, whether tech fuels business objectives—or slows them down, and ultimately decide whether companies stay modern-by-design or get left behind in insurmountable technical debt. Yet most organizations still manage these choices with spreadsheets, tribal knowledge, and gut instinct. In this talk, we'll explore why architecture copilots represent the next frontier beyond coding assistants—and why getting this right is where ROI is truly won or lost.\n\nDrawing from closed-door CTO discussions and our work with enterprises and growth-stage tech companies, we'll examine three critical challenges keeping leaders up at night: achieving visibility across their entire tech estate so they're not flying blind; getting expert advice and recommendations on how to prioritize tech roadmaps based on highest impact to business objectives; and enabling autonomous developer guidance so that developers are empowered with tailor-fit expertise as they pursue their workflow while also keeps them adhering to leadership strategy and governance.\n\nTo solve this, we’ll share what it takes to build a true architecture copilot (based on work with Catio customers across $1B+ enterprises and growth-stage companies): understanding messy systems, implicit knowledge, and constantly shifting dependencies for holistic live visibility; curating the right context around company goals and architecture excellence to inform AI recommendations that truly optimize the architecture; and defining the workflow fabric that powers teams with tailor-fit designs and expert advice while adhering to organizational standards and strategy for true autonomous decision-making.\n\nWe’ll close with a look at what this unlocks: a centralized Hub for Architecture and Tech Decision-making that transforms how companies strategically plan, build, and evolve their tech estate—not simply execute more lines of code. You'll walk away with a new lens on AI strategy: one that reframes copilots not just as coding productivity enhancers, but as strategic levers for competitive advantage, staying best-in-class-by-design, and high-ROI tech outcomes.\n\nBoris is the Co-Founder and CEO of Catio, a platform for cloud native architecture evaluation, planning, and evolution, with the help of AI. Boris is a serial entrepreneur and over the prior five years founded and lead Siden through growth to 60 people and to becoming a leader in distributed edge compute. Siden uses compute / caching placed in homes, AI to predict home content consumption, and proactive content distribution to refresh caches 24x7 using underutilized wireless network capacity. Siden uses a SaaS model to partner with wireless operators to materially expand their network capacity for Home Internet (by 2-5x), enabling them to win the Home Internet market globally (forecasted to reach 1B homes by 2032 by Qualcomm). Over his career, Boris grew 5 high caliber start-ups in total as a product-minded leader, and also funded companies from Series A to growth stages as a venture capital and private equity investor. Boris graduated the Management and Technology Program at the University of Pennsylvania with degrees from the Wharton School and School of Engineering and is a listed inventor on 15 patents.\n\n---\nSocials:\n- LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/borisbogatin/\n- X (Twitter): https://x.com/borisbogatin\n- Company: Catio (https://catio.tech)",
