      "description": "This talk introduces Meta-ACE, a learned meta-optimization framework that dynamically orchestrates multiple strategies (context evolution, adaptive compute, hierarchical verification, structured memory, and selective test-time parameter adaptation) to maximize task performance under real-world constraints. Rather than relying on uniform prompt refinement, Meta-ACE profiles each task (complexity, verifiability, feedback quality) and selects an optimal strategy bundle via a lightweight meta-controller.\n\nAlberto is a seasoned AI and ML leader with over 20 years of experience at the intersection of AI and data. A hands-on engineer, Alberto has designed and built low-latency, mission-critical ML systems, and has specialized in systematic optimization of AI pipelines and agents using custom built evaluation techniques. He is an exited co-founder having sold his previous startup, Humn.ai, to Aon in 2023, which delivered real-time, ML-powered risk prediction for mobility. Alberto is the Co-founder and CTO at Jointly, specializing in self-optimizing AI agents for regulated industries.\n\nHe holds an MSc in AI and Machine Learning and speaks at global AI conferences, including ODSC and AIAI.\n\n---\nSocials:\n- LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/albertoromero-uk/\n- GitHub: https://github.com/a-romero\n- Company: Jointly (https://getjointly.ai)",
