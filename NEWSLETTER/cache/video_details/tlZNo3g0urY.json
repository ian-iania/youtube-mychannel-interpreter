      "description": "If you’ve ever wished your repo could explain itself, catch subtle bugs, and even heal your codebase automatically, Greptile is the tool you need. In this video, I break down how Greptile builds a complete graph of your entire codebase, learns your patterns, reviews your PRs with context, catches edge-case bugs, and even gives confidence scores so you know exactly what’s safe to merge.
