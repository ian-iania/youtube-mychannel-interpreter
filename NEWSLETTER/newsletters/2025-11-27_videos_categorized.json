        "description": "GLM 4.6 is the only open-source model currently tied for #1 on the LMSYS Chatbot Arena, standing shoulder-to-shoulder with GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet. In this talk, Zhang Yuxuan from zAI breaks down the technical roadmap that led to over 100 million downloads across the GLM family.\n\nZhang deep dives into the specific training recipes behind GLM 4.6, including their move to single-stage Reinforcement Learning (RL), the \"SLIME\" RL framework for handling complex agent trajectories, and how they structured 15 trillion tokens of pre-training data. If you are building AI Agents or training LLMs, this breakdown offers a rare look inside the architecture of a frontier-class open-source model.\n\nIn this video, we cover:\n\nThe Data Recipe: How zAI filters 15T tokens, moves to repo-level code contexts, and integrates agentic reasoning data.\n\nSLIME Framework: A look at the hybrid synchronous/asynchronous architecture used to train agents without bottlenecking GPU clusters.\n\nRL Lessons: Why zAI abandoned multi-stage RL in favor of single-stage training to preserve long-context capabilities.\n\nGLM 4.5V: How native resolution processing improves UI navigation and video understanding.\n\nTimestamps:\n0:00 - Introduction & The GLM Ecosystem\n0:55 - 100 Million Downloads & Open Source Roadmap\n03:22 - Tying GPT-4o on LMSYS Arena\n05:04 - The Training Pipeline: From Pre-training to Long Context\n07:54 - Introducing SLIME: Efficient RL for Agents\n11:08 - The \"Two-Stage\" Curriculum Strategy\n11:57 - Why Single-Stage RL beats Multi-Stage RL\n12:55 - Token-Weighted Loss for Coding\n14:13 - GLM 4.5V: Multimodal & Video Understanding\n16:07 - Deployment: vLLM, SGLang, and Hugging Face\n18:06 - Coding Assistants & Future Plans\n\nZhang Yuxuan has recently started a PhD at the University of Liverpool and is currently working at Z.ai. zR (Zhang) is passionate about open-source initiatives and strives for deeper exploration in this realm. Their primary activities include the following: Engaged in research on models such as GLM-4.5 (https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06471), GLM-4.5V (https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01006), CogVideoX (https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06072), CogAgent (https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08914); researching the capabilities of model Agents and the integration with Agent frameworks such as langchain-chatchat (https://github.com/chatchat-space/Langchain-Chatchat), chatpdf (https://github.com/CosmosShadow/gptpdf); participated in several national competitions, such as RoboMaster and National Students' SmartCar Competition, and achieved some results, including national awards. These competitions have been truly fascinating. Enjoys hackathon competitions and welcomes teaming up for these events.\n\n---\nSocials:\n- LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/yuxuan-zhang-86a124282/\n- X (Twitter): https://x.com/zRdianjiao\n- GitHub: https://github.com/zRzRzRzRzRzRzR\n- Website: https://huggingface.co/ZHANGYUXUAN-zR\n- Company: Z.ai (https://z.ai)",

        "description": "Opus 4.5 takes center stage as we test real coding performance, compare Claude Code against rivals, and break down what Anthropic claims in their benchmarks. A full Opus 4.1 debunked analysis with honest results.\n\nIn today’s episode of Debunked, we put Opus 4.5 through a complete real-world breakdown to see whether Anthropic’s claims actually hold up. The hype around Opus 4.5 has been massive, especially with the benchmarks saying it beats human engineers and dominates SWE tasks—but this video digs into what Opus 4.5 truly delivers when pushed with real epics, real UI builds, and real agent-level workflows.\n\nWe compare Opus 4.5 across the same tests we previously used for Gemini, Sonnet, and GPT, and show how Opus 4.5 performs inside Cursor AI, Claude Code, and multi-step coding environments. You’ll see how Opus 4.5 handles React, Next.js, TypeScript, Swift apps, full-stack logic, and agentic workflows. And yes—we even test Opus 4.5 with real UI prompts, Apple-style layouts, and proper coding structures to see whether the model’s improvements are genuine or just marketing.\n\nAlong the way, we explain how the model behaves in autonomous-agent settings, where Opus 4.5 interacts with file systems, GitHub repos, and real codebases. We also focus on the safety issues revealed in the system card—where Opus 4.5 appears aligned but still shows reward-hacking tendencies and unusual “helpful cheating” behaviors. These hidden behaviors matter a lot when using Opus 4.5 in agentic AI workflows, especially when building long-running coding agents.\n\nTo push things further, we compare how Opus 4.5 handles UI websites versus Gemini 3 Pro, including loading times, throughput differences, layout accuracy, prompt-following, and code cleanliness. You’ll see why some implementations from Opus 4.5 inside Cursor were shockingly good, while others in Claude Code were faster and more stable. This is a complete, balanced breakdown focusing only on real outcomes—not hype.\n\nWhether you’re a developer using React, Next.js, Python, JavaScript, Node.js, Swift, or Rust… or an AI engineer building LLM agents, autonomous workflows, DevOps automations, GitHub actions, MCP tools, or API pipelines… this deep-dive will help you understand exactly what Opus 4.5 can and cannot do at a professional level.\n\nBy the end, you’ll know whether Opus 4.5 is the new best coding model in the world, whether it replaces previous Anthropic models for engineering work, and whether it truly is the “coding agent supermodel” that the benchmarks promise. No hype—just real tests.\n\nThis is Opus 4.5, explained and debunked with honesty.\n\n#opus45 #opus4_5 #claudecode #anthropic #aicoding #aiagents #agenticai\n#cursorai #vscode #llm #llmagents #aitools #aiengineer #frontend #reactjs\n#nextjs #python #javascript #swift #devops #github #automation #mcp\n#codegeneration #benchmarking #opuscoding #deepskillcoding #aicodeassist\n#claudeai #gpt5 #gemini3pro #softwareengineering",

Using Claude Skills, Claude Code, and the new design-focused features from Claude AI, I break down how you can push your AI to create genuinely aesthetic layouts instead of the usual safe, generic outputs.\n\nWe explore real examples, test Skills inside actual projects, and compare how these instructions reshape everything—from typography to themes, gradients, and component structure. If you're into AI coding, vibe coding, or building full projects with an AI partner, this video shows how far you can push design quality with the right system prompts.\n\nYou'll also see how Claude behaves inside Claude Code VSCode, what works, what breaks, and how the MCP ecosystem ties into all of this. I also compare Claude vs ChatGPT and explain how tools like Claude Code MCP and Claude MCP help load specialized expertise exactly when the model needs it.\n\nWhether you’re experimenting with AI tools, exploring new artificial intelligence workflows, or just want to learn how to use Claude for front-end design, this breakdown shows how the new Claude 4 models actually perform when put to the test.",

This approach leverages Claude Code's capabilities to transform MCPs into efficient backend APIs. Discover how Claude Skills combined with MCP as code enables progressive disclosure, smarter workflows, and better state management for AI development.\n\nIn this video, I break down Anthropic's paper on solving MCP context window problems. You'll learn why traditional MCPs consume 10%+ of your context before you even start working, and how converting them to code fixes this issue. I cover progressive disclosure for loading only what you need, context-efficient tool results that prevent data bloat, powerful control flow that reduces hallucinations, privacy-preserving operations for sensitive data, and state persistence using Claude's filesystem-based approach.\n\nWhether you're building with Claude or just curious about optimizing AI workflows, this video shows you practical solutions that software engineers have used for years—now applied to AI agents. Perfect for developers working with Model Context Protocol and anyone looking to maximize their AI agent's efficiency.\n\n#ClaudeAI #MCP #AIAgents #ClaudeCode #ModelContextProtocol #AICoding #Anthropic #ClaudeSkills #AIWorkflow #SoftwareDevelopment #AITools #MachineLearning #CodingWithAI #AIAutomation #DeveloperTools",

        "description": "I sat down with James, the Boring Marketer, to stress-test Claude 4.5 Opus against Gemini 3 Pro for real-world coding and design work. Together we live-build and compare landing pages and clickable prototypes for an “EstateClear” probate-family dashboard, then zoom out into conversion copywriting frameworks, “elevated direct response” brand voice, and ad creative workflows. The episode is a practical walkthrough of how non-technical builders can go from idea → landing page → prototype → ads using modern AI tools without vibe-coded, low-converting sites. \n\nTimestamps\n00:00 – Intro\n02:00 – Startup Idea: EstateClear\n03:17 – Claude Opus 4.5\n04:47 – Gemini 3.0 Pro\n09:02 – Reviewing Opus’ landing page\n11:16 – Reviewing Gemini’s version\n12:17 – Comparing the two\n17:29 – Reprompting Opus 4.5 and Gemini\n19:02 – Google’s vertically integrated stack (AI Studio, Anti-Gravity, TPUs, Workspace)\n21:50 – Nano Banana Pro and ad creative experiments\n27:35 – Opus 4.5 builds a clickable EstateClear prototype\n31:38 – Gemini’s prototype and comparing product depth\n36:40 – Anti-Gravity + Nano Banana workflow for mockups and code\n44:41 – Claude Skills Workflow and Best Practices\n56:41 – Final Thoughts\n\nJames is running a black friday sale for his community ($199/yr) 33% off regular price: https://www.skool.com/the-vibe-marketers/about\n\nKey Points\n\n* Claude 4.5 Opus can act like a senior engineer for non-technical builders when paired with a tight skill and tools setup.\n* Conversion wins come more from “elevated direct response” copy and clear page architecture than from fancy visuals alone.\n* Claude’s front-end design skill meaningfully reduces “AI-looking” gradients and vibe-coded layouts, producing cleaner, production-grade UIs.\n* Live tests show Opus 4.5 generates more refined layouts and deeper product thinking, while Gemini often injects clever AI product features.\n* Google’s integration of Anti-Gravity, Nano Banana, and AI Studio points to a powerful end-to-end environment for shipping and promoting products.\n\nSection Summaries\n\n1. Opus 4.5, Gemini 3, and the Modern Builder Stack\n\nGreg opens by asking what listeners will learn, and James explains his current setup: Claude Code with Opus 4.5 in the terminal, Gemini 3 Pro as a cursor/agent on the side, a handful of MCPs, and one API. He stresses that, as a non-engineer, Opus 4.5 feels like having a senior software engineer sitting beside him, especially for long, complex coding tasks. The key claim: Opus stays on track better than previous models, reducing vibe-coded-headaches and endless bug hunts. \n    \n2. From Landing Pages to Clickable Prototypes and Full Apps\n\nNext, they ask both models to build clickable prototypes of the EstateClear app. Opus 4.5 extends its design into a dashboard with progress tracking, recent activity, updates, documents, and family roles; James says it feels like a real product and notes Opus could also build the full backend with tools like Neon, Clerk, Stripe, and Vercel/Railway. Gemini’s prototype leans more into social-feeling updates and AI-assisted family messages. The consensus: both are strong MVPs, but Opus looks more thought-through as a product. \n    \n3. Nano Banana Pro, Anti-Gravity, and the Bigger Ecosystem\n\nThey explore Google’s Anti-Gravity IDE, where Gemini 3 Pro first uses Nano Banana Pro to create a high-fidelity mockup and then writes HTML/CSS based on that image—mirroring how a real team would work. James also shares Nano Banana Pro ads he’s testing for Black Friday workshops and talks about using Gemini to research top-performing ad formats, then using Nano Banana for visuals. They close by zooming out to Google’s vertically integrated stack (Workspace, TPUs, devices, AI Studio, Anti-Gravity, Nano Banana) and how it, alongside Claude, is dissolving traditional design/dev bottlenecks.\n\nThe #1 tool to find startup ideas/trends - https://www.ideabrowser.com/\n\nLCA helps Fortune 500s and fast-growing startups build their future - from Warner Music to Fortnite to Dropbox.

        "description": "On today’s episode I stress-test Gemini 3.0 in Google AI Studio to see how good it really is as a designer, not just a code generator. Across the episode, I ask Gemini to redesign my personal website in a Windows XP–inspired style, build a restaurant analytics SaaS dashboard, and create a workout mobile app inspired by the “Brain Rot” app. Along the way, I experiment with prompts, visual annotations, and reference images to see how well Gemini takes feedback. By the end, he’s rating each build.\n\nTimestamps\n00:00 – Intro\n00:54 – Personal Website\n15:48 – SaaS\n21:52 – Mobile App\n26:35 – AntiGravity\n27:17 – Final rating and takeaways\n\nKey Points\n\n* Gemini 3.0 can now generate full, styled web and mobile UIs (not just “purple Tailwind vibe-coded” layouts) when given strong prompts and references. greg-take-02\n* A Windows XP–themed personal site, built from a screenshot and a short prompt, impresses Greg enough that he considers redoing his actual homepage. greg-take-02\n* Visual annotation inside Google AI Studio (drawing on the canvas and commenting) is a powerful way to refine icons, backgrounds, and layout without “speaking designer.” greg-take-02\n* A restaurant analytics SaaS dashboard (“Chef OS”) shows how combining Dribbble shots + Teenage Engineering hardware as references pushes Gemini toward more tactile, “real button” UI. greg-take-02\n* The “Gains” workout app, modeled on the Brain Rot app, demonstrates that AI can remix an existing product pattern into a new behavior-change app with streaks, goals, and a reactive mascot. greg-take-02\n* Greg’s big takeaway: good ideas + taste + references + Gemini 3.0 let non-designers ship highly differentiated experiences, raising their odds of standing out. greg-take-02\n\nSection Summaries\n\n    \n1. RedesigningPersonal Site in a Windows XP Style\n  \n    Starting from a screenshot of gregisenberg.com, Greg prompts Gemini to make it more colorful, fresh, and “a full experience,” then adds the twist: make it feel like Microsoft XP. Gemini generates a full React/Tailwind app with an XP-like desktop: notepad, windows, and app icons for “About Greg,” “Greg’s Letter,” and guides, all wired into a working layout.\n    \n2. Designing a Restaurant Analytics SaaS Dashboard (“Chef OS”)\n    \n    Next, he feeds Gemini a Dribbble SaaS dashboard shot plus a Teenage Engineering product as visual references, asking for a clean, modern analytics-meets-AI app for restaurants with “real-world” button/knob vibes. Gemini returns a dashboard labeled “Chef OS” with an AI analyst panel, active tables, average ticket size, and tactile-feeling controls reminiscent of Teenage Engineering hardware.\n    \n3. Remixing the Brain Rot App into the “Gains” Workout App\n    \n    Finally, Greg copies Brain Rot’s App Store previews—an app his friend Yoni built to fight “brain rot” from social media—and asks Gemini to design an iOS app in that style, but for working out. Gemini outputs “Gains,” with a mascot that reacts to workout habits, a streak and goals view, and an activity calendar. Greg imagines it integrating with Apple Health and, despite minor non-functional parts, scores it 8.3/10 off a single prompt.\n    \n4. Ratings, Takeaways, and the End of the “Vibe-Coded” Era\n    \n    Greg rates the personal site 9/10, the SaaS dashboard 8.5/10, and the Gains app 8.3/10, concluding that Gemini 3.0 is “scary good” when paired with strong references and taste. He argues we’ve exited the era where no-code/vibe-coded tools produced generic, unattractive apps; now you can get to “extremely well designed” experiences without a traditional designer—as long as you bring good ideas and references. He closes by inviting listeners to experiment with Gemini 3.0 themselves and report back in the comments.\n\nWebsites Mentioned:\nLenny's Favorite PRD Templates: https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/my-favorite-templates-issue-37\n\nThe #1 tool to find startup ideas/trends - https://www.ideabrowser.com/\n\nLCA helps Fortune 500s and fast-growing startups build their future - from Warner Music to Fortnite to Dropbox.

Mas têm naturezas diferentes.\n\nO Gemini é versátil, rápido, integrado ao ecossistema Google. Perfeito para tarefas gerais.\nMas o NotebookLM tem um superpoder: a capacidade de criar contexto profundo e fazer pesquisa dentro de um ambiente controlado.\n\nEnquanto você pesquisa em outro lugar e depois traz a informação para o Gemini (perdendo qualidade no caminho), o NotebookLM permite que você faça essa pesquisa dentro da própria ferramenta — mantendo a integridade e a força das respostas.\n\nQuando você pesquisa externamente e traz dados desconectados, há perda de contexto. No NotebookLM, tudo fica integrado.\nResultado prático: respostas mais precisas, fundamentadas e prontas para usar.\n\n3 dicas para aplicar isso hoje:\n\n✅ Teste o NotebookLM para análises que exigem contexto profundo (contratos, pesquisa jurídica, documentação complexa)\n\n✅ Use o Gemini para brainstorms rápidos e tarefas que não precisam de pesquisa integrada\n\n✅ Combine as duas: use NotebookLM para a pesquisa pesada e Gemini para refinamento e formatação\n\nE você?

        "description": "Conversational AI has already proven itself as the first high-ROI enterprise AI application. But the real frontier lies beyond chat with high-value, document-centric workflows that still consume countless human hours. Enterprise Deep Research brings the power of web-scale research workflows into the private domain of your company’s data. By applying autonomous, multi-step reasoning to internal knowledge bases, enterprises can unlock transformative use cases: from drafting investment memos in financial services to automating RFP responses and due diligence. In this talk, we’ll learn what Enterprise Deep Research is, how it works, and see some example use-cases.\n\nOfer Mendelevitch leads developer relations at Vectara. He has extensive hands-on experience in machine learning, data science and big data systems across multiple industries, and has focused on developing products using large language models since 2019. Prior to Vectara he built and led data science teams at Syntegra, Helix, Lendup, Hortonworks and Yahoo! Ofer holds a B.Sc. in computer science from Technion and M.Sc. in EE from Tel Aviv university, and is the author of \"Practical data science with Hadoop\" (Addison Wesley), and of the upcoming \"Hands-on RAG for production\" (O'Reilly)\n\n---\nSocials:\n- LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ofermend/\n- X (Twitter): https://x.com/ofermend\n- GitHub: https://github.com/ofermend\n- Company: Vectara (https://vectara.com)",

Unlike simple automations that just spit out a video, this agent lets you iterate and refine results based on your feedback, just like working with a real video editor. I'll walk you through the complete setup in about 60 seconds, show you how it works with a live demo, and break down how we trained this multi-agent system so you can customize or fork it for your own niche.

They also discuss what “build → scale → govern” means for real teams.\n\nIn this video we cover: \n* Why AI is finally accessible (and why community matters) \n* “Outcomes over lines of code” and the new definition of quality \n* Citizen developers, vibe coding, and what pros should build next \n* Continuous PRs, observability, OpenTelemetry, and open agent protocols (A2A, A2UI) \n* Practical entry points, prebuilt agents, and deployment choices (Cloud Run, GKE, etc.)\n\nTL;DR: Stay curious.

        "description": "In this talk, I break down the surprising parallels between robotics and agents: embodiment, statefulness, simulation, and more. The main lesson from self-driving: everyone thought perception was hard and planning was easy. It took 8-10 years to learn we had it backwards. We're seeing the same pattern with agents today. Predictive models aren't action models. Perfect reasoning doesn't guarantee good execution.\n\nAnd just like in robotics, the company with the best infrastructure wins—not just the one with the best model. Whether you're building agents, training models, or just trying to understand why production agents are so hard, this talk covers the concepts from robotics (DAgger, MDPs, simulation, offline RL) that directly apply to making agents work at scale.\n\nJesse has spent the last 10 years as an ML engineer, starting from research in computer vision and NLP, to working on deep learning and two-tower embedding recommender systems at YouTube, to transformer-based planning models for self-driving at Waymo. He is currently working on bringing large-scale RL and simulation techniques to coding agents at Abundant.\n\n---\nSocials:\n- LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessehu\n- GitHub: http://github.com/huyouare\n- Company: Abundant (https://abundant.ai)",

        "description": "Your coding agent writes code like an LLM bot. CommandCode writes code like me.\n\nEvery developer has a coding agent now. What if your coding agent actually had taste? What if it understood not just what you're building, but how you like to build it? Your weird naming conventions. Your obsession with early returns. That thing you do where you always extract utilities before they get messy. Your coding taste.\n\nI've been building coding agents since Greg Brockman gave me GPT-3 access in 2020. Started as a CLI tool I used every day. Five years later, we've deployed over 350K agents through Langbase, and I've learned something crucial: the best agents don't just write code—they develop taste.\n\nIn this talk, I'll share what we've learned about building agents that actually feel like they know you. We'll dive into the architecture patterns that make this possible: contextual memory systems, preference learning loops, and what I call \"engineering intuition\"—going way beyond the typical \"agents.md\" approach.\n\nIt's about building agents that evolve with you, remember your decisions, and start making choices that feel like your own. By the end, you'll understand how to build coding agents that can develop taste. It's battle-tested insights from one of the largest deployment of AI agents in production today.\n\nAhmad Awais is an award-winning open-source engineering leader, founder & CEO of Langbase.com (AI Cloud powering 350K+ AI agents), Creator of CommandCode.ai.

Data Ingestion\n- Collecting documents and converting them into a processable format\n- Accepts user prompts, multimedia content, structured data, semi-structured data, and unstructured data\n\nFoundation for everything that follows\n\n2. Split into Chunks\n- Fixed-size token chunks with overlap\n- Semantic chunks via embedding similarity\n- Page-level chunks preserving layout\n\nBest strategy depends on your data structure\n\n3. Embed Chunks\n- Open Source Models: Qwen3-Emb-8B, Gemma 300M\n- Proprietary Models: text-emb-3, Cohere Embed v3\n\nConverts text into dense vector representations for semantic search\n\n4. Store in DB before Indexing\n- Vector DBs: Pinecone, Supabase, Chroma\n- Knowledge Graphs: Weaviate, Neo4j\n\nEnables fast retrieval at scale\n\n5. Augment Data\n- Performing semantic search\n- Pulling the top-k most relevant chunks\n- Combining the user query with retrieved context\n\nThis is where retrieved knowledge meets the user's question\n\n6. Generate\n- Open Source Models: Llama 4, GPT-OSS\n- Proprietary Models: GPT-5.1, Claude 4.5\n\nLLM processes augmented input to produce final response\n\n7. Evaluate Output\n- Open Source Frameworks: Langfuse, Opik\n- Proprietary: Galileo, LangSmith\n\nMeasures response quality, relevance, and factuality\n\n📌 The full flow:\n\nUser Input → Ingest → Split → Embed → Store → Augment → Generate → Evaluate\n\nEach stage compounds the quality of your final output. \n\nMiss one, and your RAG system deteriorates rapidly.\n\nThis systematic approach is what separates production RAG systems from POC projects.",

Como assim? Veja:\n\n❌ Errado: \"Busque jurisprudência sobre contestação\"\n✅ Certo: \"Baseado na contestação abaixo, busque jurisprudência relacionada\" + você cola o texto completo da sua peça\n\nParece pequeno, mas é gigante. Você está dizendo exatamente ao NotebookLM: \"Aqui está meu contexto real. Agora ache o que eu preciso.\"\n\nA IA só trabalha bem quando você dá a ela informação de qualidade. É como conversar com um colega experiente: quanto mais detalhes você dá, melhor a resposta.\n\nQuando você entende esse conceito — que contexto é a moeda de troca com a inteligência artificial — você consegue aplicar isso em qualquer ferramenta de IA. ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini... o princípio é o mesmo.\n\n3 Dicas Práticas para Aplicar Hoje Mesmo:\n\n✅ Estruture seu prompt como uma conversa real: Comece com \"Baseado em [contexto], faça [ação]\". Isso muda completamente a qualidade da resposta.\n\n✅ Cole o texto completo: Não resuma. Deixe a IA trabalhar com a peça inteira. Ela vai captar nuances que você talvez tenha perdido.\n\n✅ Teste em diferentes IAs: Depois que domina o conceito, experimenta em outras plataformas. Você vai perceber que o padrão funciona em todas.\n\nQue tal testar isso na sua próxima pesquisa jurídica? Estruture um prompt bem feito, cole sua contestação ou parecer e veja a diferença.\n\nQual é a sua maior dificuldade na pesquisa jurídica hoje? Comenta aqui — a gente adora saber! 💬 #shorts",

Use como ponto de partida, não como ponto final: A IA é sua pesquisadora 24/7, mas você continua sendo o advogado. Revise, questione, complemente com sua experiência.\n\n🎯 3. Experimente buscas de jurisprudência: Vá além dos pareceres. Use a busca profunda para mapear tendências jurisprudenciais — isso economiza tempo real de pesquisa.\n\nA pergunta não é mais \"devo usar IA no meu trabalho?\" — é \"qual ferramenta escolho e como integro no meu fluxo?\"\n\nQual dessas plataformas você já testou?

        "description": "AI systems need more than intelligence; they need context. Without it, even the most advanced models can misinterpret information, lose track of details, or arrive at conclusions that don’t hold up. Context engineering is emerging as a discipline that shapes how AI perceives, recalls, and reasons about information.\n\nThis talk will explore how context provides the foundation for reasoning, problem solving, and explainability in AI. We will look at techniques such as connected memory, contextual retrieval, and graph-based knowledge representation that give large language models a more reliable way to connect information and draw logical conclusions.\n\nAttendees will come away with a practical understanding of how to design effective context pipelines that align AI with real-world knowledge and user intent, and why context engineering is becoming a central part of building trustworthy and impactful AI systems.\n\nStephen Chin is VP of Developer Relations at Neo4j, conference chair of the LF AI & Data Foundation, and author of numerous titles including the upcoming GraphRAG: The Definitive Guide for O'Reilly. He has given keynotes and main stage talks at numerous conferences around the world including AI Engineer Summit, AI DevSummit, Devoxx, DevNexus, JNation, JavaOne, Shift, Joker, swampUP, and GIDS.

        "description": "AI copilots have already changed the game in software development. But the most strategic, highest-leverage use case is still overlooked: tech architecture decision-making. Architecture decisions drive hundreds of millions in technology spend, whether tech fuels business objectives—or slows them down, and ultimately decide whether companies stay modern-by-design or get left behind in insurmountable technical debt. Yet most organizations still manage these choices with spreadsheets, tribal knowledge, and gut instinct. In this talk, we'll explore why architecture copilots represent the next frontier beyond coding assistants—and why getting this right is where ROI is truly won or lost.\n\nDrawing from closed-door CTO discussions and our work with enterprises and growth-stage tech companies, we'll examine three critical challenges keeping leaders up at night: achieving visibility across their entire tech estate so they're not flying blind; getting expert advice and recommendations on how to prioritize tech roadmaps based on highest impact to business objectives; and enabling autonomous developer guidance so that developers are empowered with tailor-fit expertise as they pursue their workflow while also keeps them adhering to leadership strategy and governance.\n\nTo solve this, we’ll share what it takes to build a true architecture copilot (based on work with Catio customers across $1B+ enterprises and growth-stage companies): understanding messy systems, implicit knowledge, and constantly shifting dependencies for holistic live visibility; curating the right context around company goals and architecture excellence to inform AI recommendations that truly optimize the architecture; and defining the workflow fabric that powers teams with tailor-fit designs and expert advice while adhering to organizational standards and strategy for true autonomous decision-making.\n\nWe’ll close with a look at what this unlocks: a centralized Hub for Architecture and Tech Decision-making that transforms how companies strategically plan, build, and evolve their tech estate—not simply execute more lines of code. You'll walk away with a new lens on AI strategy: one that reframes copilots not just as coding productivity enhancers, but as strategic levers for competitive advantage, staying best-in-class-by-design, and high-ROI tech outcomes.\n\nBoris is the Co-Founder and CEO of Catio, a platform for cloud native architecture evaluation, planning, and evolution, with the help of AI. Boris is a serial entrepreneur and over the prior five years founded and lead Siden through growth to 60 people and to becoming a leader in distributed edge compute. Siden uses compute / caching placed in homes, AI to predict home content consumption, and proactive content distribution to refresh caches 24x7 using underutilized wireless network capacity. Siden uses a SaaS model to partner with wireless operators to materially expand their network capacity for Home Internet (by 2-5x), enabling them to win the Home Internet market globally (forecasted to reach 1B homes by 2032 by Qualcomm). Over his career, Boris grew 5 high caliber start-ups in total as a product-minded leader, and also funded companies from Series A to growth stages as a venture capital and private equity investor.

        "title": "How I Design Apps 10x Better (Free Course)",
        "description": "On this episode I sit down with indie app builder and designer Chris Raroque to break down how solo developers can make apps that truly stand out in a world of “vibe-coded” clones. Chris walks through concrete examples from his own products, Ellie (planning), Luna (budgeting), and Amy (calorie tracking), showing how small details in animations, interactions, and haptics dramatically change how an app feels. We dig into mascots and illustrations, iconography and typography, widgets and Apple Watch apps, and the design resources Chris studies to sharpen his eye. The episode is a practical blueprint for turning AI-assisted prototypes into polished, premium-feeling apps that users remember and keep coming back to.\n\n*Timestamps*\n00:00 – Intro \n03:54 – Animation and Interactions \n20:50 – Illustrations and Mascots \n33:57 – Iconography and Typography \n37:28 – Widgets \n43:04 – Design Inspiration Resources\n\n*Key Points*\n\n* In a world where anyone can ship an AI-generated app in 24 hours, polish and interaction design are the real differentiators.\n* Thoughtful animations, micro-interactions, and haptics can be the difference between a tweet that flops and one that goes viral.\n* Mascots and custom illustrations give apps a recognizable personality and can transform empty states and onboarding into memorable moments.\n* Consistent iconography and basic typography choices have outsized impact on perceived quality, yet are often overlooked by “vibe-coded” apps.\n* Home screen, lock screen, and watch widgets act as retention engines by giving apps constant real estate in users’ daily flows.\n* Continuously studying well-designed apps and curated UI libraries sharpens design taste and makes it easier to brief AI tools effectively.\n\n**Section Summaries**\n\n1. **Animations & Interactions: From Static to Standout**\nThe first major lever is animations and interactions—the difference between an obviously AI-generated, static app and something that feels alive. Chris compares two concept videos of the same calorie-tracking idea: one with minimal motion and one with thoughtful “searching” states, gradients, and source dropdowns; only the polished version goes viral and generates ~800 waitlist signups off a single tweet. The feature set is identical, but the feel is dramatically different.\n\n2. **Mascots, Illustrations, and Brand Personality**\nFrom Lily the ghost to Amy the cat, mascots become recurring characters that turn empty states, search screens, and onboarding into moments of character. Chris shares his workflow: commission or draw an original base illustration (e.g., Luna the dog), then feed it to ChatGPT to generate countless on-brand variants. He cautions against copying existing brands directly and recommends blending multiple references to get a style that’s yours.\n\n3. **Widgets, Watch Apps, and the Retention “Cheat Code”**\nChris argues that widgets and Apple Watch integrations are underused yet now easier than ever with AI. In his apps, home screen and lock screen widgets show remaining tasks, spending, or calories, and he says retention more than doubled after shipping them because users see the widgets dozens or hundreds of times a day. Lock screen slots, limited to four apps, are especially powerful: every glance at the phone becomes a subtle nudge back into the product.\n\n4. **Sharpening Design Taste with Curated Inspiration**\nTo keep leveling up, Chris constantly studies high-quality apps and motion patterns on sites like Mobbin, 60FPS, Spotted in Prod, and the Screenshot First Company Twitter feed. He uses them to decide between icon styles, discover new interactions (like gradients shifting on tap), and understand what premium App Store screenshots look like. He compares App Store screenshots to YouTube titles and thumbnails: if they’re weak, users will never give the actual experience a chance.\n\nThe #1 tool to find startup ideas/trends - https://www.ideabrowser.com/\n\nLCA helps Fortune 500s and fast-growing startups build their future - from Warner Music to Fortnite to Dropbox.

        "description": "🤖 Dicas para o Uso Profissional de IA!\n\n(Quer receber o link do grupo que tem todos os materiais gratuitos?\nSiga a @juridico.agil e comente \"EU QUERO\" que te envio no direct)\n\nImagine você usando ChatGPT para redigir uma petição inicial e receber um resultado completamente desconectado da realidade do seu caso. Frustrante, né? Pois é exatamente isso que acontece quando tratamos a IA como um \"botão mágico\" em vez de uma ferramenta que precisa ser alimentada corretamente.\n\nPor que isso importa? Porque a diferença entre um resultado medíocre e um resultado extraordinário com inteligência artificial não está na tecnologia — está em como você conversa com ela.\n\nUsar IA de forma profissional é como seguir uma receita de bolo: você precisa dos ingredientes certos nas proporções certas. E quais são esses ingredientes?\n\n1️⃣ Contexto é tudo: Quando você fornece pouca informação, a IA começa a inferir coisas — e aí surgem os problemas. O contexto é o alicerce de qualquer prompt bem-sucedido.\n\n2️⃣ O Prompt: sua conversa com a máquina\nExistem regras, existem receitas. Hoje temos vários modelos de \"cérebros\" dentro do ChatGPT e outras IAs. Você precisa entender como cada um funciona, quais são suas funcionalidades e limitações. Não é só digitar e esperar — é dialogar com inteligência.\n\n3️⃣ A Revisão é Obrigatória: Você sempre vai revisar. A IA é uma assistente, não uma substituta. Sua análise crítica, sua experiência profissional, seu julgamento — isso continua sendo insubstituível.\n\nProfissionais que dominam essa fórmula estão economizando horas de trabalho repetitivo e reinvestindo esse tempo em estratégia, relacionamento com clientes e análise complexa. Não é sobre fazer menos — é sobre fazer melhor.\n\nE você? Já está usando IA no seu dia a dia profissional? Qual é o maior desafio que você enfrenta? Comente aqui — adoramos ouvir suas histórias! 👇 #shorts",

Veja nesse vídeo os vários testes que realizei com essa nova IA de imagens da Alibaba.\n\n✅ CURSO FILMMAKER COM IA: https://manualdeia.com.br/r/cursovideo/lyw-n_xR2FM \nAprenda as melhores técnicas para criar vídeos com Inteligência Artificial.\n🔽 O QUE VOCÊ GANHA NO CURSO 🔽\n⭐ Acesso ao GERADOR DE PROMPTS;\n⭐ Acesso ao BIBLIOTECA DE PROMPTS;\n⭐ Acesso ao FÓRUM EXCLUSIVO;\n⭐ Acesso a DESCONTOS EXCLUSIVOS nos Parceiros;\n⭐ Acesso aos E-BOOKS EXCLUSIVOS do Canal;\n⭐ Acesso a Comunidade com MEU SUPORTE;\n⭐ Conteúdo Atualizado;\n⭐ Conteúdo Adicional: Curso Midjourney + Novidades;\n⭐ Conteúdo Adicional: Curso Eleven Labs;\n⭐ Periodicamente atualizado com NOVOS CONTEÚDOS;\n⭐ Acesso a TODAS AS AULAS;\n\n👉 Post com todos os links:\nhttps://www.manualdeia.com.br/z-image-turbo-a-nova-inteligencia-artificial-da-alibaba-sem-censura/\n\nSobre a Z-IMAGE TURBO\n\nA Alibaba, por meio de sua divisão de pesquisa Tongyi‑MAI, lançou o Z-Image: um modelo de geração de imagens por texto com 6 bilhões de parâmetros, desenhado para entregar resultados de alta qualidade sem exigir hardware monstruoso.\n\nO Z-Image aposta numa arquitetura inovadora chamada “Single-Stream Diffusion Transformer”. Nessa abordagem, tanto o texto quanto os embbedings visuais e os latentes da imagem barulhenta (ruído) são combinados em uma sequência única, e então processados juntos por um transformer. O resultado é uma geração eficiente, poupando recursos e acelerando o processo. \n\nO projeto conta com ao menos duas variantes já disponibilizadas: Z‑Image‑Turbo, voltada para geração rápida de imagens (text-to-image), e Z‑Image‑Edit, dedicada a edição e transformação de imagens a partir de instruções em linguagem natural. \n\nEntre os destaques do Z-Image estão: qualidade fotográfica — com atenção a detalhes de textura, iluminação, composição e atmosfera; renderização precisa de texto (suportando inglês e chinês) — importante para quem precisa colocar legendas ou sinais dentro das imagens; velocidade de inferência — a versão Turbo realiza a geração em cerca de um segundo em hardware compatível; e uso eficiente de memória — sendo executável em placas com cerca de 16 GB de VRAM, o que torna a tecnologia acessível para quem não tem GPUs top de linha.\n\nPara quem cria conteúdos visuais — como você, Ariel — o Z-Image pode representar uma ferramenta bastante poderosa. Ele permitiria gerar ilustrações, cenas cinematográficas, thumbnails, artes conceituais ou visuais para vídeos com agilidade, sem necessidade de programas gráficos pesados ou de contratar ilustradores. A capacidade de edição (via Z-Image-Edit) também abre espaço para revisões rápidas, ajustes de composição, mudanças de estilo ou refinamentos pontuais.\n\nEm resumo, o Z-Image marca um passo interessante na democratização da IA generativa para imagens: um modelo relativamente enxuto, mas que entrega resultados de alta qualidade, com desempenho rápido e uso acessível. Isso sugere não apenas avanços técnicos, mas um movimento concreto para tornar ferramentas de criação visual restornadas a mais pessoas.\n\nSe você quiser, posso fazer uma análise crítica de Z-Image — apontando pontos fortes e limitações prováveis, pensando no seu contexto de produção de vídeos com IA.\n\n#seedream #nanobananapro #zimageturbo #manualdeia #alibaba",

        "description": "Nano Banana PRO 4K é melhor que o Seedream 4.0 4K? Nesse vídeo vamos analisar junto se realmente vale a pena usar a versão 4k do Nano Banana PRO. Fiz vários testes até chegar em uma opinião sincera.\n\n✅ CURSO DE FILMMAKER COM IA: https://manualdeia.com.br/r/cursovideo/THelKd2KrFo \nAprenda criar filmes, web séries, animes, imagens incríveis!\n\n🔽 O QUE VOCÊ GANHA 🔽\n⭐ Acesso ao GERADOR DE PROMPTS;\n⭐ Acesso ao BIBLIOTECA DE PROMPTS;\n⭐ Acesso ao FÓRUM EXCLUSIVO;\n⭐ Acesso a DESCONTOS EXCLUSIVOS nos Parceiros;\n⭐ Acesso aos E-BOOKS EXCLUSIVOS do Canal;\n⭐ Acesso a Comunidade com MEU SUPORTE;\n⭐ Conteúdo Atualizado;\n⭐ Conteúdo Adicional: Midjourney + Novidades;\n⭐ Conteúdo Adicional: Eleven Labs;\n⭐ Periodicamente atualizado com NOVOS CONTEÚDOS;\n\nNANO BANANA PRO 4K É DE VERDADE MESMO?\n\nA versão 4K de qualidade do Nano Banana PRO representa um salto notável para criadores visuais que exigem não apenas “imagem bacana”, mas também nitidez, fidelidade e controle refinado. Quando falamos de “4K de qualidade”, estamos falando de resoluções que chegam a cerca de 3840 × 2160 pixels ou mais,  o que significa que cada detalhe importa: texturas sutis, sombras complexas, gradações de cor delicadas. Essa alta resolução permite que miniaturas, vídeos ou banners de grande porte mantenham impacto visual mesmo em telas maiores. Para quem produz conteúdo com ferramentas de IA ou trabalha com efeitos visuais de nível profissional, essa qualidade extra oferece margem para recortes, zooms e adaptações sem que a imagem perca sua definição.\n\nMas a versão 4K de qualidade do Nano Banana PRO não se resume apenas a “ser maior”. Ela entrega controle criativo ampliado: você pode ajustar iluminação, trocar o ângulo da câmera, brincar com profundidade de campo, alterar o clima da cena,  por exemplo transformar um dia ensolarado em uma noite intensa,  e ainda modificar a composição com precisão. Para quem cria vídeos, miniaturas ou vinhetas, isso significa passar de uma produção “meio improvisada” para algo claramente mais polido, com visual que parece sair de um estúdio. Além disso, esse nível de controle reduz retrabalho e facilita adaptação de ativos para diferentes plataformas, algo que pode economizar tempo e manter consistência visual em várias entregas.\n\nUm outro diferencial importante é a integração de texto, tipografia e multilinguagem dentro da obra visual,  não como um elemento “colocado por cima”, mas sim como parte do próprio design. Isso é especialmente relevante para campanhas, pôsteres, materiais de marketing ou vídeo-introduções onde o texto precisa estar integrado à imagem de forma nítida e legível. Em conjunto, mantêm-se consistência de marca, elementos visuais estáveis e rígido controle de identidade,  algo que muitos criadores amadores não conseguem sem horas de edição manual. Para seu canal de YouTube, onde miniaturas e introduções cinematográficas são ponto forte, isso significa levar o visual a outro nível, com arte pronta para uso profissional e menos necessidade de ajustes finos depois.\n\nMesmo com todas as vantagens,  e elas são substanciais,  é importante considerar os limites práticos da versão 4K de qualidade do Nano Banana PRO. Criar em 4K exige mais recursos, tanto computacionais quanto de concessão (quota ou assinatura). Mesmo a melhor IA pode produzir artefatos visuais ou inconsistências quando a cena é extremamente complexa ou o prompt não está bem especificado. Da mesma forma, exportar em 4K não garante automaticamente que a versão final exibida (por exemplo no YouTube ou redes sociais) manterá todo esse nível de detalhe,  compressões, formatos e plataformas podem acabar reduzindo ganhos. Então, embora a ferramenta ofereça o “poder bruto”, a eficiência realmente vem quando você alinha qualidade visual, fluxo de trabalho e propósito de entrega.\n\nEm resumo, a versão 4K de qualidade do Nano Banana PRO é uma ferramenta de peso,  ideal para criadores exigentes que querem controle, fidelidade e versatilidade para seus visuais. Se seu foco é miniaturas de alta performance, vídeos com introduções cinematográficas ou ativos visuais que se destacam em telas grandes ou ambientes de produção mais “corporativo”, então esse modelo eleva o nível. Para operações mais simples ou com restrição de recursos, pode-se avaliar se o ganho justifica o investimento. Mas para seu perfil,  produção de vídeo com IA, miniaturas marcantes, conteúdo visual de impacto,  ela representa um avanço significativo. Se quiser, posso investigar como está o custo no Brasil, quais planos existem e se há comparação local com outras ferramentas semelhantes,  posso seguir por esse caminho.\n\n#nanobanana2 #nanobananapro #nanobanana #manualdeia",

        "title": "🔥 GEREI 1000 IMAGENS NO NANO BANANA PRO E ESSE FOI O PROMPT DEFINITIVO!",
        "description": "A Google está elevando o nível na geração de imagens por inteligência artificial com o lançamento do Nano Banana PRO, seu mais recente modelo de edição e criação visual que se baseia na arquitetura do Gemini 3 Pro.\n\n✅ CURSO DE FILMMAKER COM IA: https://manualdeia.com.br/r/cursovideo/bG-wpngwgiQ \nAprenda criar filmes, web séries, animes, imagens incríveis!\n\n🔽 O QUE VOCÊ GANHA 🔽\n⭐ Acesso ao GERADOR DE PROMPTS;\n⭐ Acesso ao BIBLIOTECA DE PROMPTS;\n⭐ Acesso ao FÓRUM EXCLUSIVO;\n⭐ Acesso a DESCONTOS EXCLUSIVOS nos Parceiros;\n⭐ Acesso aos E-BOOKS EXCLUSIVOS do Canal;\n⭐ Acesso a Comunidade com MEU SUPORTE;\n⭐ Conteúdo Atualizado;\n⭐ Conteúdo Adicional: Midjourney + Novidades;\n⭐ Conteúdo Adicional: Eleven Labs;\n⭐ Periodicamente atualizado com NOVOS CONTEÚDOS;\n\nSOBRE NANO BANANA PRO\n\nA novidade chega num momento em que as demandas por criatividade assistida por IA ganham força — imaginou transformar simples ideias em imagens de qualidade de estúdio, com controle refinado e precisão textual? Isso é exatamente o que o Nano Banana PRO promete entregar.\n\nO modelo foi concebido para ir além das versões anteriores da marca “Nano Banana”. Em vez de focar somente em gerar belas imagens, ele incorpora raciocínio avançado e conhecimento do mundo real para traduzir conceitos para visuais elaborados, diagramas e infográficos. Ele permite que o usuário peça, por exemplo, “crie um infográfico sobre o ciclo da água com dados reais” ou “gere um cartaz bilíngue para evento esportivo”, e obtenha algo mais do que uma estética bacana: algo com coerência, legibilidade e contexto.\n\nEntre os destaques do Nano Banana PRO está a renderização de texto dentro da imagem, não só frases curtas, mas parágrafos completos em múltiplos idiomas, com fontes, estilos, caligrafias ou tipografia conforme o contexto. Essa funcionalidade é especialmente relevante para criadores de conteúdo, designers ou quem trabalha com material educacional ou corporativo, onde a clareza visual e textual é crítica. Além disso, o modelo introduz controles criativos muito mais apurados: ajuste de iluminação, foco, ângulo de câmera, composição de múltiplas imagens de referência (até 14 imagens) e consistência de personagens (até 5 pessoas mantidas iguais em variações). Em termos de qualidade, ele suporta resoluções elevadas, adequadas para uso profissional.\n\nNa prática, o Nano Banana PRO está sendo integrado em vários produtos da Google — o app Gemini, o Workspace, Slides, Vids, entre outros. Assim, não é mais preciso ser um especialista em softwares gráficos para gerar peças visuais sofisticadas: bastam descrições em linguagem natural e o modelo faz o trabalho pesado. Por exemplo, no Slides é possível selecionar “Beautify this slide” e o sistema automaticamente aplica o modelo para transformar o conteúdo numa arte visual atraente e precisa.\n\nPara empresas e criadores, isso representa uma mudança de paradigma: a velocidade de produção visual pode disparar, e a consistência com identidade de marca ou estilo visual torna-se mais factível. A Google aponta que o modelo ajuda a produzir campanhas localizadas globalmente ao lidar com tradução e renderização de texto em diferentes idiomas, ou ainda a criar materiais de treinamento técnico com infográficos gerados diretamente pelo modelo. A marca-d água invisível (SynthID) também acompanha os ativos gerados, algo que reforça o compromisso com transparência no uso de IA.\n\nMas nem tudo é simples brilho — alguns desafios permanecem. Embora o controle criativo seja elevado, ainda depende de um bom prompt, ou seja, de instruções precisas dadas pelo usuário. Quanto mais específico for o comando (com cena, estilo, composição, texto, idioma, etc.), melhor o resultado. Também existe limitação de cota na versão gratuita, o que significa que usuários que trabalham em escala poderão precisar de assinaturas ou planos empresariais para liberar todo o potencial da ferramenta.\n\nEm resumo, o Nano Banana PRO representa um salto significativo na geração de imagens assistida por IA, especialmente para quem precisa de qualidade, controle e precisão, quer seja para marketing, educação, design ou conteúdo.

        "description": "Engineering teams are spending millions on AI coding tools, but most have no idea what's actually working. Without hard data, you're flying blind – unable to tell which teams are actually using AI effectively. But what if you had access to workflow data from 200,000 engineers and 20 million pull requests across a thousand companies?\n\nIn this talk, we'll share insights from usage data spanning the entire AI engineering ecosystem. We've observed significant productivity gains at scale, including a 2x increase in PR throughput and 24% faster cycle times on average.\n\nYou'll learn what \"good\" adoption looks like (hint: autonomous agents aren't there yet), what productivity gains are possible, and what side effects to expect. More importantly, we'll explore why some teams don't see these gains. We'll show how your code architecture\" is a critical, often overlooked factor.\n\n---\nSocials:\n- LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/arcolano/\n- X (Twitter): https://x.com/arcolano\n- GitHub: https://github.com/arcolano\n- Company: Jellyfish (https://jellyfish.co)",

        "description": "Everyone says AI changes everything. Dax Raad argues that when it comes to building a winning product, AI changes nothing.\n\nIn this contrarian talk, Dax breaks down why the fundamental challenges of product success: marketing, onboarding, and retention remain stubbornly human problems that AI cannot solve. He argues that while AI can generate content, it cannot generate cool. While it can write code, it cannot design the deep primitives required for long term retention.\n\nKey Takeaways:\n- Marketing is about Cool: You need to create things that people feel compelled to share. AI is too corny to help you here.\n- The \"Aha\" Moment: You must ruthlessly eliminate friction to get users to the singular moment they understand your product. This requires deep, opinionated taste, not algorithmic optimization.\n- Primitives over Features: To retain power users, you must build deep primitives first and simple experiences second. AI cannot hallucinate the right mental model for your problem space.\n\nWinning still requires hard work, deep taste, and human ingenuity. And that's a good thing.\n\nDax Raad is a core contributor to SST, the framework that makes it easy to build serverless applications. He is a well-known voice in the developer community, advocating for better developer experiences and honest product thinking.\n\n---\nSocials:\n- X (Twitter): https://x.com/thdxr\n- GitHub: https://github.com/thdxr\n- Website: https://thdxr.com/\n- Company: OpenCode (https://opencode.ai)",

A companhia foca em resolver desafios técnicos complexos, como a criação de um mecanismo de dobradiça que minimize o vinco no painel e assegure a durabilidade do aparelho. Patentes registradas indicam a exploração de diferentes formatos, embora a abordagem da empresa pareça priorizar o refinamento da tecnologia antes de sua introdução formal no mercado.\nAs previsões sobre o cronograma de lançamento do primeiro iPhone dobrável permanecem especulativas. Relatórios baseados em fontes da cadeia de suprimentos indicavam inicialmente uma possível estreia em 2026. Contudo, análises mais recentes sugerem que desafios na produção e o rigoroso controle de qualidade da empresa podem adiar a apresentação do produto para 2027. Esta abordagem metódica visa garantir que o dispositivo atenda aos padrões de usabilidade e resistência esperados pela marca.\n\n\n🚩 NO INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/ctofertas/...\n😍 INSCREVA-SE NO NOSSO CANAL 👍\nhttps://canalte.ch/assineyoutube\n\n👉INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/canaltech/\n👉FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/canaltech\n👉TWITTER: https://twitter.com/canaltech\n👉TIKTOK: https://www.tiktok.com/@canaltech",

        "description": "🔥Lista de recomendações do Canaltech por faixa de preço🔥: \n ➡ https://canalte.ch/guiadecompra\n🔥Lista de produtos do Canaltech🔥:\n➡ https://canalte.ch/ProdutosCT\n🔥 PARA ECONOMIZAR: CANAL DE OFERTAS NO WHATSAPP 🔥\nhttps://canalte.ch/canalofertas\n\n➡Confira dezenas de notícias todos os dias em nosso site\n➡ https://canalte.ch/ctoigyt\n\nO aumento da pirataria digital está associado à fragmentação do mercado de entretenimento e ao encarecimento de serviços e produtos. No universo do streaming, a multiplicação de plataformas dispersou o conteúdo, exigindo múltiplas assinaturas para um acesso variado. De forma semelhante, no mercado de games, os preços elevados de lançamentos, a exclusividade de títulos em determinadas lojas digitais e a proliferação de conteúdos adicionais pagos (DLCs) criam barreiras financeiras. Essa conjuntura leva parte dos consumidores a buscar métodos alternativos para acessar obras sem arcar com os custos crescentes e a complexidade de múltiplos serviços.\n\nA experiência do usuário, antes mais centralizada, tornou-se mais restritiva, impulsionando a busca por soluções unificadas. A presença de tecnologias de gestão de direitos digitais (DRM) em jogos, que por vezes podem impactar negativamente o desempenho dos produtos legalmente adquiridos, também é um fator que incentiva a pirataria. Nesse cenário, o consumo ilegal ressurge como uma via que oferece acesso simplificado e sem custos diretos, apesar dos riscos de segurança e da ilegalidade. A percepção de um custo-benefício desfavorável nos modelos de negócio atuais, tanto em filmes e séries quanto em jogos, impulsiona a adesão a essas práticas.\n\n🚩 NO INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/ctofertas/...\n😍 INSCREVA-SE NO NOSSO CANAL 👍\nhttps://canalte.ch/assineyoutube\n\n👉INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/canaltech/\n👉FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/canaltech\n👉TWITTER: https://twitter.com/canaltech\n👉TIKTOK: https://www.tiktok.com/@canaltech",

        "description": "Um vídeo de uma suposta robô humanoide com pele sintética altamente realista viralizou nas redes sociais. O material reage ao toque de forma incrivelmente similar à pele humana, sendo capaz de se dobrar e retornar à forma original de maneira natural.\n\nEmbora não haja confirmação da origem exata do vídeo – e muitos suspeitem que tenha sido gerado por inteligência artificial – a gravação desencadeou um intenso debate online. O consenso é que a tecnologia está muito próxima das chamadas \"namoradas robóticas\".\n\nO vídeo polêmico gerou discussões sobre a ética no uso comercial de humanoides. Questões levantadas incluem a normalização da prostituição, a substituição de parceiros e o impacto social da criação de companheiros robóticos.\n\nApesar da possível natureza fake do vídeo, a tecnologia por trás de peles sintéticas avançadas e humanoides realistas está progredindo rapidamente, impulsionada pela IA. O debate ético sobre seu uso já é urgente e inevitável.\n\nLeia mais no #TecMundo. \n#robô #ia #humanoide #viral #ética #tecnologia #pele #futuro #robótica #debate #inovação #sintética #ciência #relacionamento #redessociais",

O fogo começou em um dos estandes na tarde de quinta-feira, mas felizmente não houve feridos.\n\nO Corpo de Bombeiros do Pará agiu rapidamente e controlou as chamas em apenas seis minutos, utilizando 244 extintores e mangueiras. Um total de 56 bombeiros e uma equipe externa de combate atuaram na resposta ao incidente.\n\nA principal suspeita é que o fogo tenha sido causado por um equipamento eletrônico, possivelmente um forno de micro-ondas instalado no estande. Este tipo de falha em aparelhos elétricos é uma causa comum de incêndios.\n\nO incidente suspendeu temporariamente as negociações cruciais da conferência. A organização da COP30 está avaliando o ocorrido e deve dar um parecer sobre a retomada das atividades na Blue Zone.\n\nLeia mais no #TecMundo. \n#cop30 #incêndio #clima #tecnologia #eletrônico #microondas #negociação #ambiental #segurança #bombeiros #conferência #risco #brasil #onu #sustentabilidade",

        "description": "Download the slides, soundtrack and other resources from this talk at: https://vibecodinghangover.com\n\nInspiration strikes! You fire up your favorite AI coding agent and tell it \"Build me an app that...\" The agent grinds away, furiously, and spits back a torrent of code and it works! You’re a masterful rebel in the AI revolution!\n\nBut, then, you want to change something. You want to add a feature. You want to evolve it to production software; or, perhaps you come back to it a week later. You realize you don't understand it, can't maintain it, and have to throw most or all of it all away.\n\n\"Vibe Coding\" is the low-spec, zero-planning approach to AI accelerated development that feels productive but results in brittle, unmaintainable demoware. The hangover is the resulting despair when you try to build maintainable, understandable software this way. The cure is building software with AI coding agents by applying this framework.\n\nYou’ll love this talk if:\n\n- You value programming as a daily learning experience.\n- You want to understand and own this software as you do all of the other software that you write.\n- You want to be the boss of the coding agents, not their confused intern.\n- Working with AI coding agents makes you feel like a prompt jockey, no longer an AI engineer.\n- You're sick of throwing away code, burning time and tokens.\n- You want to use coding agents to build production applications that do real work.\n\nWe'll walk through a practical framework - comprising a set of Principles, a Process, and Tools - that enables AI engineers to build, own, and maintain complex, real-world software applications using AI coding agents. This is not a conceptual framework, it is applied. It has been distilled and simplified from years of engineering work in the trenches of building software with AI coding agents. This framework has been taught and implemented across many teams, and has transformed the productivity of AI engineers in companies from solo shops to Fortune 500. We'll focus on the first crucial phase of software development: \"Make it Work,” with clear ties to apply the framework to the remaining phases of “Make it Right” and “Make it Fast”.\n\n00:00 The Vibe Coding Hangover\n01:24 Introduction\n03:31 The Framework - Overview\n04:52 Principles\n16:46 Process - Overview\n17:28 Process - Planning\n38:26 Process - Implementation\n48:29 Tools\n56:10 The Morning After\n\nCorey J. Gallon is Head of an AI-native holding company and a battle-hardened AI engineer with a focus on building real, scaled software with AI coding agents. He is an AI coding agents OG, building coding agents since 2022 and one of the most significant contributors to GPT-Engineer (evolved into the startup Lovable). He was formerly Chief Innovation Officer, designer and leader of development of a large consulting firm's enterprise-scale AI coding agents platform. Corey is founding faculty of a university graduate AI & ML program, an artisan of specialty coffee, and a pickleball fanatic.\n\n---\nSocials:\n- LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/coreygallon\n- X (Twitter): https://x.com/coreygallon\n- GitHub: https://github.com/captivus\n- Website: https://gallon.me\n- Company: Rexmore (https://rexmore.ai)",

        "description": "Software with zero bugs sounds absurd, or even impossible, in anything but simple situations, but it has been built. For example, NASA's Space Shuttle software achieved near-perfection (1 error per 420,000 lines) using rigorous engineering practices. This feat was achieved decades ago, yet cost prevented the techniques used from becoming mainstream.\n\nThis talk traces seventy years of innovation in software quality and programmer productivity, ranging from structured programming to formal verification. While many of these techniques have been too costly to implement on a large scale, AI changes that. What is more, agentic coding needs them to compensate for its limitations.\n\nWe are on the verge of a world where aerospace-level reliability becomes the practical in a broad range of applications.\n\nJohann Schleier-Smith is Technical Lead for AI at Temporal Technologies, the leading provider of durable execution. He previously founded Crystal DBA, which developed agents to manage cloud infrastructure and was acquired by Temporal. He also co-founded if(we), which built a collection of social networks with over 300 million members and was acquired by The Meet Group (NASDAQ:MEET). Johann serves on the board of Sama, a leading provider of training data for computer vision applications. He holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science from UC Berkeley and an A.B. in Physics and Mathematics from Harvard University.\n\n---\nSocials:\n- LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/jssmith/\n- X (Twitter): https://x.com/jssmith\n- GitHub: https://github.com/jssmith\n- Website: https://johann.schleier-smith.com/\n- Company: Temporal Technologies (https://temporal.io/)",

Através de um aplicativo instalado tanto no dispositivo do administrador quanto no do dependente, é possível estabelecer regras digitais de acordo com as necessidades de cada família. A plataforma possibilita a definição de limites de tempo de uso diário, o bloqueio de aplicativos específicos e a aprovação de novos downloads e compras na Google Play Store. O sistema foi projetado para promover um ambiente digital mais seguro, oferecendo aos responsáveis um maior controle sobre o conteúdo acessado.\n\nAlém do gerenciamento de aplicativos e tempo de tela, o Family Link também oferece recursos de localização, permitindo que os pais saibam onde a criança está, desde que o dispositivo esteja ligado e conectado à internet. Outra funcionalidade relevante é o bloqueio remoto do aparelho, útil para momentos como a hora de dormir ou de fazer as tarefas escolares. A ferramenta ainda gera relatórios de atividade que detalham o tempo gasto em cada aplicativo, auxiliando os responsáveis a entenderem os hábitos digitais de seus filhos e a orientá-los sobre um uso mais equilibrado e consciente da tecnologia.\n\n\n➡Confira dezenas de notícias todos os dias em nosso site\n➡ https://canalte.ch/ctoigyt\n\n\n\n🚩 NO INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/ctofertas/...\n😍 INSCREVA-SE NO NOSSO CANAL 👍\nhttps://canalte.ch/assineyoutube\n\n👉INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/canaltech/\n👉FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/canaltech\n👉TWITTER: https://twitter.com/canaltech\n👉TIKTOK: https://www.tiktok.com/@canaltech",

A série SE, embora equipada com processadores potentes, mantém um design datado, com bordas proeminentes e uma tela de tamanho reduzido, o que limita a experiência de consumo de mídia. Já a série Mini, que foi descontinuada, buscava atender ao nicho de aparelhos compactos, mas seu principal ponto fraco sempre foi a autonomia de bateria, consideravelmente inferior à dos modelos principais, tornando-a inadequada para um uso mais intenso.\n\nO iPhone Air, por sua vez, foi introduzido como um modelo conceitual focado em um design ultrafino. No entanto, essa característica impõe seus próprios desafios. Para atingir sua espessura mínima, o aparelho faz sacrifícios em componentes, resultando em uma capacidade de bateria que pode não ser ideal para usuários avançados. Além disso, seu sistema de câmeras, embora competente, é inferior ao dos modelos Pro, posicionando o iPhone Air em uma categoria intermediária onde o principal atrativo é a estética, o que pode não justificar o investimento para quem busca o máximo de performance ou versatilidade fotográfica.\n\n🚩 NO INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/ctofertas/...\n😍 INSCREVA-SE NO NOSSO CANAL 👍\nhttps://canalte.ch/assineyoutube\n\n👉INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/canaltech/\n👉FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/canaltech\n👉TWITTER: https://twitter.com/canaltech\n👉TIKTOK: https://www.tiktok.com/@canaltech",

Equipado com o processador MediaTek Dimensity 7300, tela pOLED de 6,67 polegadas com resolução 1.5K e taxa de atualização de 120Hz, o aparelho oferece um desempenho fluido para tarefas diárias e jogos. Um dos seus principais atrativos é a resistência, com certificações IP68 e IP69, que garantem proteção contra água e poeira, algo incomum no segmento. A bateria de 5.200 mAh e o conjunto de câmeras com sensor principal de 50 MP e estabilização óptica (OIS) complementam o pacote.\n‎\nNo mercado, o principal concorrente do Moto G86 é o Samsung Galaxy A56. Enquanto o modelo da Motorola se destaca pela maior autonomia de bateria e pela construção mais resistente, o dispositivo da Samsung oferece um desempenho superior em benchmarks, câmeras consideradas mais otimizadas e uma política de atualizações de software mais longa. Outros aparelhos como o Xiaomi Redmi Note 14 Pro e modelos da própria Motorola, como o Edge 50 Fusion, também surgem como alternativas a serem consideradas, disputando a preferência do consumidor que busca o melhor conjunto de especificações pelo menor preço.\n‎\nTítulos alternativos:\n► Moto G86 vale a pena?

O iPhone 14 permanece como uma opção relevante para quem busca um desempenho sólido com um orçamento mais controlado, enquanto o iPhone 15 se destaca por atualizações como a Dynamic Island e a conexão USB-C, representando um salto tecnológico mais recente. A decisão entre eles depende da análise das diferenças de processamento, capacidade das câmeras e o valor do investimento durante o período promocional.\n\nParalelamente, a expectativa em torno dos futuros lançamentos, como os especulados iPhone 16 e iPhone 16e, adiciona uma camada de complexidade à decisão. Consumidores ponderam se os descontos aplicados aos modelos 14 e 15 na Black Friday são suficientes para justificar a compra imediata, ou se seria mais vantajoso aguardar as inovações da próxima geração. Este comparativo avalia o ciclo de vida de cada aparelho e o impacto dos novos modelos na desvalorização dos anteriores.\n\n🚩 NO INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/ctofertas/...\n😍 INSCREVA-SE NO NOSSO CANAL 👍\nhttps://canalte.ch/assineyoutube\n\n👉INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/canaltech/\n👉FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/canaltech\n👉TWITTER: https://twitter.com/canaltech\n👉TIKTOK: https://www.tiktok.com/@canaltech",

Errado.\n\nIdentificamos dois grandes vilões nessa história:\n\n1️⃣ A ilusão da facilidade: Quando você vê aquele chat respondendo rapidinho, parece mágica. Mas aí vem o problema: alucinações. A IA inventa jurisprudência, cita doutrina que não existe, e você sai por aí usando como se fosse ouro puro. Isso não é só impreciso — é perigoso pro seu cliente.\n\n2️⃣ O mito do \"trabalho muito personalizado\"\nMuitos advogados ainda dizem: \"Meu trabalho é muito específico, IA é só pra contestações em massa\". Aqui está o segundo erro. Na verdade, a IA é extremamente contextual. Quanto mais detalhes você alimenta o sistema, melhor ela entende seu caso. O impacto positivo vem justamente quando você sabe usar bem essa capacidade de processar nuances.\n\nA IA não é vilã nem salvadora — é uma ferramenta que exige estratégia. Assim como em qualquer mudança de gestão, você precisa:\n\n✅ Validar sempre — Nunca use uma citação jurisprudencial gerada por IA sem conferir na fonte original\n\n✅ Alimentar com contexto — Quanto mais detalhes você der sobre seu caso, melhor será o resultado\n\n✅ Treinar seu time — A implementação de IA não é só tecnologia, é mudança de mentalidade\n\n✅ Testar antes de escalar — Comece com tarefas menores, entenda como a ferramenta funciona no seu contexto\n\nQual é o seu maior medo ao usar IA na advocacia?

E sabe por quê? Porque não escolheram o \"cérebro\" certo ou não souberam como usá-lo.\n\nHoje temos múltiplos modelos de IA disponíveis — ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini e tantos outros. Cada um funciona de forma diferente, com capacidades e limitações distintas. Mas aqui está o ponto crítico: a maioria dos profissionais não entende realmente como esses \"cérebros\" trabalham.\n\nA IA pode alucinar informações. Pode inventar casos que nunca existiram. Pode citar conflitos fictícios. E quando você não sabe forçar a ferramenta a buscar informação verificável — seja na internet ou em bases de dados específicas — você está jogando dados com sua reputação.\n\nA Solução: Três Passos Práticos\n\n1️⃣ Escolha o modelo certo para sua tarefa\nNem toda IA é igual. Pesquise qual modelo tem melhor performance para o que você precisa (pesquisa jurídica, análise de contratos, redação).\n\n2️⃣ Force a ferramenta a buscar fontes verificáveis. Não aceite respostas genéricas. Instrua a IA a consultar bases de dados específicas, jurisprudência atualizada ou documentos que você forneça.\n\n3️⃣ Revise sempre. Sempre mesmo.\nA revisão não é opcional — é obrigatória. Nenhuma IA substitui o olho crítico de um profissional. Você é o guardião da qualidade.\n\nA tendência é clara: a IA vai piorar para melhorar. Haverá mais erros antes de termos sistemas mais confiáveis. Mas quem entender como escolher e usar essas ferramentas corretamente sairá na frente.\n\nA IA é poderosa.

Naive RAG\n\n- Direct retrieval with no sophisticated filtering or feedback\n- Example: Customer support chatbots answering FAQs from documentation\n\n2\\. Agentic RAG\n\n- Autonomous planning, tool use, and dynamic retrieval strategies\n- Example: Competitive intelligence analysts who autonomously monitor and analyze competitor data\n\n3\\. HyDE (Hypothetical Document Embeddings)\n\n- Generates \"hypothetical\" documents for better retrieval matching\n- Example: Adaptive Technical search where users describe problems differently than usual\n\n4\\. Graph RAG\n\n- Structures data as knowledge graphs for richer contextual reasoning\n- Example: Medical support systems generating hypothetical patient cases based on symptom relationships\n\n5\\.

        "description": "The Beneficial AGI Summit & Unconference 2025 (BGI-25) convened leading AI researchers, innovators, policymakers, and technologists from October 21 to 23 in Istanbul, Türkiye, to examine critical developments in AI and discuss how to guide AGI toward a future defined by compassion and abundance.\n\nThe Summit kicked off with an opening keynote by Dr. Ben Goertzel, CEO of SingularityNET and the ASI Alliance, introducing \"Hyper-Intelligent Economics,\" a mathematical and quantitative framework modeling economic evolution as least-effort geodesics between current conditions and potential futures.\n\nApplying this to analyze Singularity pathways under various competition structures and potential shocks, Dr. Goertzel demonstrated both the difficulty of re-targeting social and economic trajectories once they begin to lock in and that \"infrastructure is the best investment\" for preventing unfavorable outcomes, advocating for broad coverage and \"periphery-first activity\" over targeted wealth transfers.\n\nThe BGI Conversation Continues Online\nTo deepen connections, continue conversations, and co-create real progress toward Beneficial AGI, join the BGI Nexus community calls, workshops, working groups, and showcases: https://www.bginexus.io/events\n\n #AGI #DecentralizedAGI\n\n----\n\nSingularityNET was founded by Dr. Ben Goertzel with the mission of creating a decentralized, democratic, inclusive, and beneficial Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). An AGI is not dependent on any central entity, is open to anyone, and is not restricted to the narrow goals of a single corporation or even a single country.\n\nThe SingularityNET team includes seasoned engineers, scientists, researchers, entrepreneurs, and marketers.

        "description": "Um estudante universitário chinês de 21 anos, Huang Yanjun, construiu uma armadura de exoesqueleto controlada por voz com inteligência artificial, inspirada no filme \"Homem de Ferro\". O projeto foi criado em apenas dois meses durante as férias de verão e rapidamente viralizou nas redes sociais.\n\nO exoesqueleto é uma construção completa com painéis que se abrem e fecham automaticamente, ativada por comandos de voz que imitam o assistente de IA \"Jarvis\" dos filmes. Para construir o traje, Huang utilizou a tecnologia de impressão 3D, montando os componentes em uma única peça.\n\nHuang, que estuda Design Mecânico, Manufatura e Automação, demonstrou desde cedo interesse por eletrônicos e inovações. Ele transformava peças de aparelhos antigos em novos itens e já havia criado um robô assistivo de caminhada, para o qual buscou patentear.\n\nO traje não é apenas estático; ele se move suavemente e pode ser equipado com efeitos de fumaça e laser para demonstrações. A criação destaca o alto nível de engenharia e criatividade do estudante chinês, misturando tecnologia de ponta com paixão por ficção científica.\n\nLeia mais no #TecMundo.\n#exoesqueleto #ia #robótica #china #tecnologia #homemdeferro #armadura #impressão3d #estudante #invenção #viral #engenharia #automação #futurista #cosplay",

Câmeras de segurança flagraram o ladrão, que estava aparentemente sob efeito de substâncias, cometendo a invasão na madrugada.\n\nA ação bizarra durou mais de duas horas e foi marcada por um momento constrangedor: o suspeito ficou preso na porta giratória do banco por quase 20 minutos. Durante o esforço para se soltar, ele perdeu a bermuda e acabou ficando apenas de cueca.\n\nApós conseguir passar pela porta, o homem danificou ao menos três caixas eletrônicos com chutes e socos, mas não conseguiu furtar nenhuma quantia em dinheiro. Antes de tentar sair, ele ainda parou para checar a garrafa de café em uma mesinha, sem sucesso.\n\nA polícia chegou ao local mais de duas horas depois do início da invasão, acionada pela empresa de vigilância. O rapaz foi encontrado escondido debaixo de uma escada e levado para a delegacia, onde confessou a tentativa de roubo.\n\nLeia mais no #TecMundo.\n#vídeo #crime #segurança #banco #ladrão #viral #portagiratoria #mg #polícia #câmeras #furto #redessociais #brasil #notícia #bizarro",

        "description": "A tornozeleira eletrônica violada por Jair Bolsonaro, que tentou abri-la com um ferro de solda, tem uma origem surpreendente: a ideia de sua criação veio de uma história em quadrinhos do Homem-Aranha de 1977. O juiz americano Jack Love se inspirou ao ver o vilão Rei do Crime monitorando o herói.\n\nO dispositivo pesa apenas 128 gramas e funciona com GPS, modem e dois chips de operadoras diferentes, garantindo rastreamento 24 horas por dia para uma central de monitoramento. A pulseira é reforçada com fibra ótica para disparar um alarme automático em caso de dano.\n\nNo caso de Bolsonaro, o relatório de monitoramento registrou \"marcas de queimadura\" no aparelho após ele alegar que teve uma \"alucinação\" de que o dispositivo tinha uma escuta. A tornozeleira também possui sensores que garantem o rastreamento ininterrupto, mesmo em áreas sem sinal de celular.\n\nO custo de aluguel mensal da tornozeleira aos cofres públicos varia entre R$ 300 e R$ 500 por detento. O próprio juiz criador testou o aparelho em si por três semanas antes de implementá-lo no sistema judiciário.\n\nLeia mais no #tecmundo!\n#tornozeleira #bolsonaro #rastreamento #tecnologia #segurança #justiça #política #gps #monitoramento #quadrinhos #brasil #eletrônica #prisão #custo #inovação",

        "description": "O astrofotógrafo Andrew McCarthy e o paraquedista Gabriel C. Brown uniram forças para criar \"A Queda de Ícaro\", uma imagem inédita que registra a silhueta de um corpo humano em queda livre alinhada perfeitamente diante do Sol. A composição, que exigiu seis tentativas e precisão milimétrica, não é montagem.\n\nCapturada em luz hidrogênio-alfa, a fotografia revela com nitidez as manchas solares e a intensa atividade na superfície da estrela. No momento exato do disparo, a figura de Brown surge recortada, descendo em queda controlada, um feito de sincronia e técnica.\n\nA ideia surgiu de uma conversa informal após um salto de paraquedas. O planejamento foi complexo: McCarthy usou múltiplas câmeras e se comunicou com Brown e o piloto de um paramotor, que monitorava a sombra da aeronave para prever o alinhamento com o ponto do fotógrafo.\n\nO salto decisivo ocorreu às 9h da manhã, exigindo que toda a operação estivesse perfeitamente sincronizada. A imagem já é considerada uma das melhores da carreira de McCarthy, demonstrando como criatividade, ciência e coragem podem se unir para registrar momentos únicos na astrofotografia.\n\nLeia mais no #TecMundo. \n#fotografia #sol #paraquedismo #ciência #arte #astrofotografia #imagem #tecnologia #criatividade #queda #liberdade #natureza #estrelas #céu #aventura",

        "description": "Uma imagem de satélite do Google Maps, mostrando a palavra \"HELP\" (socorro) e \"tráfico\" escritas em areia num terreno baldio em Los Angeles, viralizou nas redes sociais. A foto gerou especulações e preocupação sobre um possível caso de tráfico humano ou um pedido desesperado de ajuda.\n\nO print do Google Maps circulou intensamente, levando internautas a debaterem o significado das mensagens visíveis apenas do alto. Muitos expressaram choque e medo, imaginando cenários aterrorizantes por trás dos sinais.\n\nContudo, a polícia de Los Angeles e a Union Pacific, dona do terreno, esclareceram o mistério. As investigações concluíram que os sinais foram escritos há cerca de um ano por um morador de rua com transtornos mentais, que já foi removido do local.\n\nApesar do susto, as autoridades afirmam que ninguém está em perigo. O caso serve como um lembrete de como imagens de satélite e redes sociais podem amplificar situações, gerando alarme público sem a confirmação dos fatos.\n\nLeia mais no #TecMundo. \n#googlemaps #viral #socorro #satélite #tecnologia #redessociais #mistério #losangeles #investigação #imagem #tráfico #polícia #curiosidade #urbana #entulho",
